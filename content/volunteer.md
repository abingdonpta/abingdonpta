# Volunteer Opportunities

## Volunteer with the PTA

If you're interested in volunteering with the PTA, a great first step is to fill out our Volunteer Form so we can learn more about your interests, skills, and availability.

***Completion of the form is not a commitment to volunteer.*** After you complete the form, we will reach out to you to see if you're interested in a particular role or committee. We always need more volunteers!

Additionally, the PTA requests volunteers to help with events on an ad hoc basis. [Please follow or subscribe to one of our communication tools](/connect), or fill out the Volunteer Form, in order to be informed of these volunteer opportunities. Typically volunteers help set up before events, clean up after events, or assist during events. This is a fun way to meet people and become familiar with the PTA.

If you're interested in a more structured role, [we maintain a list of officer and coordinator roles here](/leadership). If there's a position available that you're interested in taking on, please fill out the Volunteer Form and/or reach out to us at abingdonelementaryPTA@gmail.com. If you're interested in a role that is already filled, you may reach out to the person in that position to ask if they need any help. Even if they don't require help now, they may want to teach a successor how to perform the role. It never hurts to ask.

Finally, if you want to get involved but you're not sure how, please reach out to us at abingdonelementaryPTA@gmail.com. There is a role for everyone!

The PTA is run entirely by volunteers. We depend on your help through your time, talent, and financial contributions. We invite families to attend our events, participate in our fundraisers, join the PTA, and otherwise get involved in any way you would like!

## Volunteer with Abingdon Elementary

We also recommend that parents and other community members sign up to volunteer directly with the school. These volunteer opportunities include reading to students, chaperoning field trips, and other fun and enriching activities.

APS requires that all parents volunteering in the building complete a Volunteer Application. In addition to verification of an applicant's identity, COVID-19 vaccination is required for the application to be approved. The process takes about a week to complete.
