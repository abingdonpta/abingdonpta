Please see below for the wish lists of our teachers. Thank you in advance for supporting their classrooms! *Please note, you are not obligated to purchase anything from the wish lists.*

{{< hint warning >}}
APS policy prohibits teachers from accepting gift cards to purchase classroom supplies, so please do not send them in.
{{< /hint >}}

When sending packages directly to the school, please include "ATTN: [Staff name]" on the 2nd address line and include a free gift note with the teacher's name. This ensures the package is delivered to the correct teacher.

If you work at Abingdon and would like your wishlist featured on this page, please email the PTA at pta@abingdonpta.org.
