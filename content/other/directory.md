The PTA works with a vendor to produce and maintain an **online student directory** for our school. This new resource contains contact information for studentsâ€™ families to help those in the Abingdon community connect to arrange playdates or carpools, discuss classroom activities, share other school-related information, and more.

To learn more about the school directory, including how to create an account to access it, [read the announcement for the launch of the 2022-2023 directory](/2022/12/01/directory).
