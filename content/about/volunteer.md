## Volunteer with the PTA

If you're interested in volunteering with the PTA, a great first step is to fill out our Volunteer Form so we can learn more about your interests, skills, and availability. We always need more volunteers!

Additionally, the PTA requests volunteers to help with events on an ad hoc basis. [Please follow or subscribe to one of our communication tools](/connect), or fill out the Volunteer Form, in order to be informed of these volunteer opportunities. Typically volunteers help set up before events, clean up after events, or assist during events. This is a fun way to meet people and become familiar with the PTA.

The PTA is run entirely by volunteers. We depend on your time, talent, and financial contributions to do all that we do.

## Volunteer with Abingdon Elementary

We also recommend that parents and other community members sign up to volunteer directly with the school. These volunteer opportunities include reading to students, chaperoning field trips, and other fun and enriching activities.

APS requires that all parents volunteering in the building complete a Volunteer Application. Propsective volunteers:
- provide proof of receiving a COVID-19 vaccine
- take a training that is provided by APS
- have a criminal background check processed by APS

 The process takes about a week to complete.
