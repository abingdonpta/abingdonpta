## Edukit

Edukit offers prepackaged school supplies that are tailored to meet the needs of each grade at Abingdon Elementary. The program makes it simple for families to acquire what they need, and it also serves as a fundraiser for the PTA.

## Read-A-Thon

Abingdon holds a Read-A-Thon every year â€” a fundraiser when students track the number of pages they read over the course of two weeks and and sponors (usually parents and grandparents) pledge to give to the PTA a certain amount of money for each page the student has read. The PTA also awards prizes to students and classes who have read the most. The Read-A-Thon is the biggest PTA fundraiser of the year.

## Spirit Gear

We aren't currently selling Spirit Gear (t-shirts, hats, etc.), but we hope to start soon. Check our newsletter and social media for updates on Spirit Gear availability.

A portion of the proceeds go to the PTA.

## Spirit Nights

The Abingdon PTA is excited to host Spirit Nights at local restaurants. Check our newsletter and social media for updates about Spirit Nights.
