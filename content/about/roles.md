## 🎓 Educational Programs Role Descriptions

### 🍅 Garden Coordinator

Abingdon Elementary has a garden in the front of the building, to the right of the main entrance. (The garden is sometimes called an "outdoor classroom.") The goal of the garden is to enrich students' and families' knowledge of environmental sustainability and to be good stewards of our Earth, while providing first hand experience in learning about our food supply and our pollinators. More information can be found on the [garden page](/garden), and from our [garden newsletter](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSc62Xf5rFUBG1XqElQa2VQJUJu8k8Kf0RWTWPzoemf8bOLF-A/viewform?usp=sf_link).

The Garden Coordinator works with Abingdon's Sustainability Coordinator (traditionally the science teacher) to organize garden cleanups, help with procuring supplies, and any other assistance. The Garden Coordinator maintains a list of community volunteers who may be called upon to help. The garden is a great way to get the community invested in Abingdon's success.

The Reflections Chair organizes Abingdon's Reflections program by publicizing the program and recruiting volunteers to help judge the submissions. To make things easier, the National PTA publishes a "[Local Leader's Guide](https://www.pta.org/docs/default-source/files/programs/reflections/current_reflections-21-22/21-22_local-leaders-guide_reflections69c84cf1aa3e63899f67ff00009b2bd9.pdf)" which provides step-by-step instructions on how to manage the Reflections program. They also provide [a great deal of promotional material](https://www.pta.org/home/programs/reflections/startyourprogram) that our PTA can use to raise awareness of the program.

Due to a lack of volunteers, the Abingdon PTA has not participated in the Reflections program in several years. During the 2022-23 school year, we would like to bring back Reflections to Abingdon.

## 🎉 Event Descriptions

### 👋 Back to School Picnic

The PTA's Back to School Picnic has been a tradition for many years. It's held on the weekend before the first day of school. It's a wonderful way for kids and families to reconnect. The picnic is a potluck in which the PTA provides some food while attendees bring side dishes, fruits & vegetables, and desserts.

### 🎃 Trunk or Treat

In 2021, the PTA held a Trunk or Treat in which volunteers decked out their cars in spooky setups and handed out candy to costumed visitors. In prior years, the PTA held a Fall Festival with games and other activities.

The PTA organized Winter Wonderland in 2022 with music, games, alpacas, and a garden cleanup.

The PTA held its first Book Swap in 2022. Volunteers collected donated kids' books (from families and from businesses), placed them on tarps in front of the school on a pleasant Saturday afternoon, and invited the community to take and/or leave books over the course of two hours. Everyone enjoyed the opportunity to refresh their book collection for free. It was also a great lead-in to the Read-a-Thon fundraiser.

### 📷 Photographer

Volunteers are needed to take pictures at school events for the Abingdon and PTA website, yearbook, Facebook and Twitter accounts.

- **Location**: School
- **Time of day**: Mostly evenings and weekends, but some daytime availability is a plus

- **Location**: Home
- **Time of day**: Any
- **Months**: Year-round

### ☎️ Directory Coordinator

The Abingdon PTA intends to create a student directory during the 2022-2023 school year. This would be the first student directory in several years. It will contain information for only those families who have opted in to share such information with the PTA via the checkbox on the Annual Online Verification Process that all families complete annually.

### 📄 Copy Coordinator

Abingdon students typically bring home to their parents a paper folder from the school each Tuesday (the "Tuesday folder") containing work that they have done in the previous week, as well as various flyers and other updates from the school. These may include updates from the PTA, including flyers for upcoming events. Many parents learn about PTA events from flyers placed in the Tuesday folders.

The Copy Coordinator is responsible for copying PTA flyers on Monday mornings and distributing the appropriate number of flyers to each classroom teachers' mailbox. (The classroom teachers then place the flyers in each student's Tuesday folder.) Occasionally, copies may need to be made on a Friday before a holiday on Monday.

It is ideal to have at least two people in this role, if not more, to ensure coverage each week. While we have many ways of sharing information with families, paper flyers are still the best way to get a message across to the most people.

- **Location**: School
- **Time of day**: School day
- **Months**: Year-round

### 🌎 Translator

Translators help the PTA by translating emails and flyers into other languages that are commonly spoken by Abingdon families. Approximately 160 families at Abingdon speak Spanish at home, and about 30 families each speak Arabic, Amharic and Mongolian at home.

### 🍎 Room Buddy Coordinator

The PTA is starting a "Room Buddies" program. You may have heard about "Room Parents" or "Class Moms" at other schools, and this is intended to be similar.

The Room Buddy Coordinator recruits Room Buddies for as many classrooms as possible. The Coordinator also occasionally polls Room Buddies to get a pulse on various issues or needs throughout the school.

- **Location**: Home, perhaps occasionally school to recruit additional Room Buddies
- **Time of day**: Any; occasional daytime availability is a plus for in-person recruitment at dropoff and pickup
- **Months**: Year-round

### 🧸 Lost and Found Coordinator

Abingdon has a lost and found near the front entrance. As students rifle through the lost and found looking for their items, it gets messy quite quickly. The lost and found becomes especially full in the fall and the spring, when it is cold in the morning but warmer in the afternoon so that children take off their jackets outside during recess and forget them.

A Lost and Found Coordinator hangs up jackets (which are the most frequently lost item) and organizes other lost items, like water bottles, perhaps once or twice each week. They also take photos of the lost and found once every month or two for social media so that parents can see whether their child's items need to be picked up.

- **Location**: Home
- **Time of day**: Evening
- **Months**: March and April

### ✅ Audit Committee

The Virginia PTA requires that each PTA audit their finances at the conclusion of each school year. (This is sometimes called a financial review.) In practice, the audit is more like a checklist, and no financial experience is required to serve on the Committee.

At least three people need to serve on the committee. The Treasurer provides their records to the Committee at the end of the fiscal year (July 1). The Committee drafts the financial report and submits it to the Executive Board and to the general membership in August for their approval at the first meeting of the school year in September. In practice, the Committee spends a few hours in July reviewing the financial records from the prior school year and meets once in order to finalize the report.
