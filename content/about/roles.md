## üíº Officer Role Descriptions

### ü¶∏ President

The President's official responsibilities are described in [the bylaws](/bylaws/#article-6-duties-of-officers).

### üßô Vice President

The Vice Presidents' official responsibilities are described in [the bylaws](/bylaws/#article-6-duties-of-officers).

In our PTA, Vice Presidents oversee a certain subject area (for example, fundraising or educational programs) and provide supervision and guidance to coordinators in that subject area, while representing their programs with the Executive Board. They may also choose to directly perform much of the work in their subject area.

### üí∞ Treasurer

The Treasurer's official responsibilities are described in [the bylaws](/bylaws/#article-6-duties-of-officers).

The Treasurer manages the PTA's funds and all of the records relating to those funds.

### ‚úçÔ∏è Secretary

The Secretary's official responsibilities are described in [the bylaws](/bylaws/#article-6-duties-of-officers).

## üéì Educational Programs Role Descriptions

### üçÖ Garden

Abingdon Elementary has a garden in the front of the building, to the right of the main entrance. (The garden is sometimes called an "outdoor classroom.") The goal of the garden is to enrich students' and families' knowledge of environmental sustainability and to be good stewards of our Earth, while providing first hand experience in learning about our food supply and our pollinators. More information can be found on the [garden page](/garden), and from our [garden newsletter](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSc62Xf5rFUBG1XqElQa2VQJUJu8k8Kf0RWTWPzoemf8bOLF-A/viewform?usp=sf_link).

The Garden Coordinator works with Abingdon's Sustainability Coordinator (traditionally the science teacher) to organize garden cleanups, help with procuring supplies, and any other assistance. The Garden Coordinator maintains a list of community volunteers who may be called upon to help. The garden is a great way to get the community invested in Abingdon's success.

Reflections is a national PTA-sponsored program that encourages students to express themselves artistically. Learn more about Reflections [on the National PTA's website](https://www.pta.org/home/programs/reflections).

The Reflections Chair organizes Abingdon's Reflections program by publicizing the program and recruiting volunteers to help judge the submissions. (The National PTA recommends that local units recruit a committee of 4-6 parent and teacher volunteers.) To make things easier, the National PTA publishes a "[Local Leader's Guide](https://www.pta.org/docs/default-source/files/programs/reflections/_evergreen-program-materials/local-leader-resources/local-leaders-guide_reflections.pdf)" which provides step-by-step instructions on how to manage the Reflections program. They also provide [a great deal of promotional material](https://www.pta.org/home/programs/reflections/startyourprogram) that our PTA can use to raise awareness of the program.

## üéâ Event Descriptions

### üëã Back to School Picnic

The PTA's Back to School Picnic has been a tradition for many years. It's held on the weekend before the first day of school. It's a wonderful way for kids and families to reconnect. The picnic is a potluck in which the PTA provides some food while attendees bring side dishes, fruits & vegetables, and desserts.

### üéÉ Trunk or Treat

The PTA screened movies in the cafeteria before the pandemic. We are still evaluating how to continue this tradition. We welcome your input and your labor to make it happen!

### ‚òï Parent Coffees

The PTA has occasionally provided coffee to parents before and after school in order to build and strengthen relationships with our fellow parents, as well as to inform parents about PTA goings-on and to recruit volunteers.

### üéà Rising Kindergarten Playdates

The PTA organizes playdates for rising kindergarteners in the spring and summer before they will start school. This is a wonderful way for rising kindergarteners to make friends and to become more comfortable with the school, and for parents to meet each other.

### üìö Book Swap

The PTA held its first Book Swap in 2022. Volunteers collected donated kids' books (from families and from businesses), placed them on tarps in front of the school on a pleasant Saturday afternoon, and invited the community to take and/or leave books over the course of two hours.

### üìÑ Photocopying Flyers

Abingdon students typically bring home to their parents a paper folder from the school each Tuesday (the "Tuesday folder") containing work that they have done in the previous week, as well as various flyers and other updates from the school. These may include updates from the PTA, including flyers for upcoming events. Many parents learn about PTA events from flyers placed in the Tuesday folders.

We need volunteers to photocopy PTA flyers on Monday mornings and to distribute the appropriate number of flyers to each classroom teachers' mailbox. (The classroom teachers then place the flyers in each student's Tuesday folder.) Occasionally, copies may need to be made on a Friday before a holiday on Monday.

It is ideal to have at least two people in this role, if not more, to ensure coverage each week. While we have many ways of sharing information with families, paper flyers are still the best way to get a message across to the most people.

- **Location**: School
- **Time of day**: School day

Translators help the PTA by translating emails and flyers into other languages that are commonly spoken by Abingdon families. Approximately 160 families at Abingdon speak Spanish at home, and many families speak Arabic, Amharic, Mongolian and Persian at home.

### üß∏ Lost and Found

Abingdon has a lost and found near the front entrance. As students rifle through the lost and found looking for their items, it gets messy quite quickly. The lost and found becomes especially full in the fall and the spring, when it is cold in the morning but warmer in the afternoon so that children take off their jackets outside during recess and forget them.

A Lost and Found Coordinator hangs up jackets (which are the most frequently lost item) and organizes other lost items, like water bottles, perhaps once or twice each week. They also take photos of the lost and found once every month or two for social media so that parents can see whether their child's items need to be picked up.

- **Time of day**: School day
- **Months**: Year-round

Members of the Nominating Committee identify PTA members interested in serving as officers, and report to the general membership a list of nominees for the annual election.

At least three people need to serve on the committee. The committee needs to be up and running by March. The nominating committee submits the officer nominees to the general membership in April so that the election can be held in May.

- **Location**: Home
- **Time of day**: Evening

### ‚úÖ Audit Committee

The Virginia PTA requires that each PTA audit their finances at the conclusion of each school year. (This is sometimes called a financial review.) In practice, the audit is more like a checklist, and no financial experience is required to serve on the committee.

At least three people need to serve on the committee. The Treasurer provides their records to the committee at the end of the fiscal year (July 1). The committee drafts the financial review and submits it to the Virginia PTA by August 1. The general membership then votes to approve the financial review at their first meeting of the school year in September. In practice, the committee spends a few hours in July reviewing the financial records from the prior school year and meets once in order to finalize the review.
