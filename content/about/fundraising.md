## Read-A-Thon

Abingdon holds a Read-A-Thon every year - a fundraiser when students track the number of pages they read over the course of two weeks and and sponors (usually parents and grandparents) pledge to give to the PTA a certain amount of money for each page the student has read. The PTA also awards prizes to students and classes who have read the most. The Read-A-Thon is the biggest PTA fundraiser of the year.

## Spirit Gear

We aren't currently selling Spirit Gear (t-shirts, hats, etc.), but we hope to start soon. Check our newsletter and social media for updates on Spirit Gear availability.

A portion of the proceeds go to the PTA.

## Spirit Nights

The Abingdon PTA is excited to host Spirit Nights at local restaurants. Check our newsletter and social media for updates about Spirit Nights.
