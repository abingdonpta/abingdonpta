## Institutional Documents

### Bylaws

The Abingdon PTA is required to adhere to the [Virginia PTA Local Unit Uniform Bylaws](https://www.vapta.org/27-committees/bylaws). Our local PDF version [can be found here](/bylaws/2022-2023.pdf), while an easy-to-read webpage with the bylaws is maintained below.

### Organizational Structure Form

The Organizational Structure Form provides important details about how this PTA conducts business, including timing of elections and term limits on officers. The PTA must complete this form and have it approved by the general membership at the beginning of each school year. The Treasurer then submits the form to the Virginia PTA.

### Conflict of Interest Policy

The policy is intended to ensure that PTA leadership is not enriching themselves under the pretense of conducting PTA business. The PTA is required to adhere to such a policy in order to maintain its tax-exempt status. The PTA adopted this policy on January 19, 2022 and it remains in force indefinitely.
