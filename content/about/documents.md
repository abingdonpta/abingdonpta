## Institutional Documents

### Bylaws

The Abingdon PTA is required to adhere to the [Virginia PTA Local Unit Uniform Bylaws](https://www.vapta.org/27-committees/bylaws). Our local PDF version [can be found here](/bylawsfolder/2022-2023.pdf), while an easy-to-read webpage with the bylaws is maintained below.

### Organizational Structure Form

The Organizational Structure Form provides important details about how this PTA conducts business, including timing of elections and term limits on officers. The PTA must complete this form and have it approved by the general membership at the beginning of each school year. The Treasurer then submits the form to the Virginia PTA.

### Conflict of Interest Policy

The policy is intended to ensure that PTA leadership is not enriching themselves under the pretense of conducting PTA business. The PTA is required to adhere to such a policy in order to maintain its tax-exempt status. The PTA adopted this policy on January 19, 2022 and it remains in force indefinitely.

The audit is submitted to the Virginia PTA and also must be approved by the general membership in the beginning of the next school year.

## Tax Documents

### Employer Identification Number (EIN)

Abingdon PTA's EIN is **52-1289072**. This is also known as a "Tax ID."

### IRS Form 990

The PTA Treasurer is required to submit this form to the IRS and to the Virginia PTA each year in order to maintain its tax-exempt status. We will start filing these again once our tax exemption is reinstated.

| IRS Form 990 |
|-|
| Coming soon |

### IRS Determination Letter

When the IRS has reviewed our application for tax-exempt status and decides that we meet the requirements for a 501(c)(3) organization, it will send us a "determination letter" officially approving our application and designating us a tax-exempt organization under the Internal Revenue Code. We will place that letter here when we receive it.

## Provided As Needed

- **Insurance Policy**: The PTA is required to be covered by insurance at all times. The policy is submitted to the Virginia PTA each year.
- **Tax Exemption Letter from Virginia PTA**: After the PTA has sent all of the required documents to the Virginia PTA, it receives a letter confirming that it is a tax-exempt subordinate to the Virginia PTA. PTA volunteers can use this letter to solicit donations from businesses, as it provides assurance that any donations made to the PTA are tax-deductible.
- **Sales Tax Exemption Letter**: Once the PTA's tax-exempt status is reinstated, we will apply for a sales tax exemption from Virginia's Department of Taxation. This will allow the PTA to purchase items without paying sales tax.
- **Application for Tax Exempt Status (IRS Form 1023)**: The PTA's tax exempt status was revoked years ago, and the PTA submitted this form to the IRS on January 22, 2022 in order to request that the tax-exempt status be reinstated.
- **Logos**: We retain vector image files of the Abingdon Cardinal logo and the Abingdon PTA logo.
