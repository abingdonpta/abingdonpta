### IRS Determination Letter

When the IRS has reviewed our application for tax-exempt status and decides that we meet the requirements for a 501(c)(3) organization, it will send us a "determination letter" officially approving our application and designating us a tax-exempt organization under the Internal Revenue Code. We will place that letter here when we receive it.

## Other Documents

### Conflict of Interest Policy

The policy is intended to ensure that PTA leadership is not enriching themselves under the pretense of conducting PTA business. The PTA is required to adhere to such a policy in order to maintain its tax-exempt status. The PTA adopted this policy on January 19, 2022 and it remains in force indefinitely.

## Provided As Needed

- **Insurance Policy**: The PTA is required to be covered by insurance at all times. The policy is submitted to the Virginia PTA each year.
- **Tax Exempt Letter from Virginia PTA**: After the PTA has sent all of the required documents to the Virginia PTA, it receives a letter confirming that it is a tax-exempt subordinate to the Virginia PTA. PTA volunteers can use this letter to solicit donations from businesses, as it provides assurance that any donations made to the PTA are tax-deductible.
- **Sales Tax Exemption Letter**: Once the PTA's tax-exempt status is reinstated, we will apply for a sales tax exemption from Virginia's Department of Taxation. This will allow the PTA to purchase items without paying sales tax.
