## What is the PTA?
PTA stands for **P**arent **T**eacher **A**ssociation.

The Abingdon Elementary PTA is an active and enthusiastic group of parents and teachers working together to give our students the best possible educational and social experience during elementary school.

## What does the PTA do?
For over 70 years, Abingdon's PTA has supported Abingdon Elementary and the surrounding community by:

- **Events**: Organizing events that bring the community together
- **Staff Appreciation**: Showing appreciation for Abingdon staff with acts of kindness and generosity
- **Community Relations**: Raising funds to provide food, clothing, and school supplies to families who cannot afford them
- **Educational Programs**: Providing extra learning opportunities to children by organizing after-school classes, art contests, and other activities
- We also **fundraise** to achieve these goals, and regularly **communicate** with parents and staff in order to raise awareness of our work and recruit volunteers.

## What type of role can I contribute as a member of the PTA?
There are roles for everyone, and it depends on your interests and skillset:
- **Bilingual** - We can always use help translating our emails and other communications.
- **Organizer** - You can lead a committee or help plan an event.
- **Technically savvy** - You can update and manage our website.
- **Financially savvy** - You can review our credit card statements and audit our finances. (Or serve as Treasurer!)
- **Just want to participate** - We have several events throughout the year and can use volunteers.
[Check out the roles listed here.](/roles/), and then fill out our [volunteer form](/volunteer/).

## Does it cost money to be a part of the PTA?
Annual membership dues are $5 per adult. However, you do not have to be a dues-paying member to volunteer for the PTA or to attend meetings. Membership is required if you want to vote during meetings or be a PTA officer.

Dues can be submitted online, or via check or cash if necessary. [Click here for information about paying dues.](/join/)

## Do I have to be a parent to join the PTA?
No. Everyone — parents & guardians, educators, students and other community members — is invited to join our PTA.

Our bylaws state that, "Membership ... shall be open, without discrimination, to anyone who believes in and supports the mission and purposes of National PTA."

## How often are PTA meetings held?
General membership meetings are held once a month while school is in session, typically on the second Tuesday of each month. We recommend that as many parents and staff attend as possible; however, we publish [meeting minutes](/documents/) after each meeting on this website, which we recommend reading if you are unable to attend our meetings.

## How can I submit a topic to be addressed for a PTA meeting?
You can email the PTA at abingdonelementaryPTA@gmail.com.

## What are the funds raised from the fundraiser use for?
PTA funds are used to support the school and the community, including:
- Securing vendors, food, and rental equipment for events
- Support teacher appreciation activities and supplies
- Supplies for educational programs, including the school garden and the school play
- Contributions to charity drives

## I am not English speaking; how can I speak/participate in another language?
- Our meetings and our website are all accessible in other languages.
- There are many volunteer opportunties which do not require English fluency, especially helping with events. Fill out our [volunteer form](/volunteer/) or email abingdonelementaryPTA@gmail.com (in whatever language you'd like) if you are interested in volunteering with us.

## What type of committees are available?
- Staff Appreciation Committee (organize and execute events for teachers and other staff members)
- Events Committee (events that are held at Abingdon)
- Nominating Committee (identifying PTA officers for the following school year)
- Audit Committee (auditing the previous school year's finances)

## How does the PTA communicate with parents?
- All of our communication methods are listed [here](/connect/). We especially recommend subscribing to our e-mail newsletter, the Cardinal Courier.
