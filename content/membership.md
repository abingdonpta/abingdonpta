description: Become a member of the Abingdon PTA today!

Everyone — parents & guardians, educators, students and other community members — is invited to join our PTA.

Membership dues are $5 per adult per year. You do not have to be a dues-paying member to volunteer for the PTA or to attend meetings. Membership is required if you want to vote during meetings or be a PTA officer.
