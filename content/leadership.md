## 💪 Coordinator Role Descriptions

### 📱 Social Media Coordinator

The Abingdon PTA maintains a Twitter account and a Facebook page. The Social Media Coordinator uses these accounts to share information about PTA activities, as well as to share pertinent updates from Abingdon and from APS.

### 📰 Newsletter Coordinator

The Cardinal Courier is the PTA's weekly e-newsletter, distributed via Constant Contact. It is the main way that the PTA updates families on PTA activities.

The Newsletter Coordinator helps to gather updates from other PTA coordinators for inclusion in the newsletter, and may draft original content as well.

### 🖥️ Website Administrator

The website administrator maintains this very website, adding and updating content when necessary.

### 💬 WhatsApp Administrator

The PTA operates WhatsApp groups for Abingdon families. The WhatsApp administrator moderates these groups, shares PTA information in the groups and helps answer questions that families have about the PTA and about Abingdon.

### 🗯️ Facebook Administrator

The PTA operates a Facebook group for Abingdon families. The Facebook administrator moderates these groups, shares PTA information in the group and helps answer questions that families have about the PTA and about Abingdon.

### ☎️ Directory Coordinator

The Abingdon PTA intends to create a student directory during the 2022-2023 school year. This would be the first student directory in several years. It will contain information for only those families who have opted in to share such information with the PTA via the checkbox on the Annual Online Verification Process that all families complete annually.

The Directory Coordinator collects and organizes student and family data as provided by the school registrar and formats the information to prepare for inclusion in the online student directory on MemberHub. (Memberhub is a free system provided by the Virginia PTA.)

### 🖼️ Graphic Designer

The Graphic Designer(s) designs PTA flyers and may also help design new Spirit Gear products.

### 📄 Copy Coordinator

Abingdon students typically bring home to their parents a paper folder from the school each Tuesday (the "Tuesday folder") containing work that they have done in the previous week, as well as various flyers and other updates from the school. These may include updates from the PTA, including flyers for upcoming events. Many parents learn about PTA events from flyers placed in the Tuesday folders.

The Copy Coordinator is responsible for copying PTA flyers on Monday mornings and distributing the appropriate number of flyers to each classroom teachers' mailbox. (The classroom teachers then place the flyers in each student's Tuesday folder.) Occasionally, copies may need to be made on a Friday before a holiday on Monday.

### 🌎 Translator

Translators help the PTA by translating emails and flyers into other languages that are commonly spoken by Abingdon families. Approximately 160 families at Abingdon speak Spanish at home, and about 30 families each speak Arabic, Amharic and Mongolian at home.

Translators may also help us translate live PTA meetings if they are able to do so, though this is not necessary. We would be grateful for any help that a translator is able to provide.

### 💸 Passive Fundraising Coordinator

The Passive Fundraising Coordinator identifies corporate rebate programs and subscribes the PTA to them. Some examples include:
- Amazon Smile (likely the most significant rebate program)
- Harris Teeter
- Giant
- Safeway
- Target REDcards

The Coordinator also works with the PTA communications team to publicize these programs.

### 👕 Spirit Wear Coordinator

Spirit Wear are items with Abingdon branding on them, typically the Cardinal logo, that the PTA sells to families as a fundraiser or simply to foster school spirit. (It can also include magnets, bumper stickers, and other items that aren't necessarily "worn.")

The Spirit Wear Coordinator is responsible for researching the various options for procuring Spirit Wear. Along with the Executive Board, they select which vendor we use. They also place and track orders, manage inventory, and oversee distribution.

### ✏️ Edukit Coordinator

The Edukit program organizes pre-packaged school supplies to sell to Abingdon families. This helps ensure that families can procure the proper school supplies for their students quickly and easily, and is also a fundraiser for the PTA.

The Edukit Coordinator oversees the Edukit program. In the spring the coordinator communicates with the school to get supply lists from each grade, and communicates with the EduKit rep to get the program up and running, including checking the EduKit lists to ensure accuracy. In August the coordinator spends a few hours at the school (with other volunteers) to distribute the boxes to each teachers' classroom. There's no money collection and minimal spreadsheets, though there is a form to complete. The role mostly entails facilitating the program and staying on top of dates and communication. The work is mostly done from home, except for August distribution.

### 📷 School Pictures Coordinator

Picture Day is held twice annually at Abingdon - once in the fall and once in the spring. The PTA organizes Picture Day in coordination with a vendor. Picture Day provides families with a snapshot of their children and also serves as a fundraiser for the PTA.

The School Pictures Coordinator selects dates in consultation with school officials, distributes photo order packets to teachers, works with photographers to ensure picture days run smoothly, and distributes photo packages to students via teachers.

### 📚 Read-A-Thon Coordinator

Abingdon holds a Read-A-Thon every year - a fundraiser when students track the number of pages they read over the course of two weeks and and sponors (usually parents and grandparents) pledge to give to the PTA a certain amount of money for each page the student has read. The PTA also awards prizes to students and classes who have read the most. The Read-A-Thon is the biggest PTA fundraiser of the year.

The Read-A-Thon Coordinator:
- Schedules the Read-A-Thon in consultation with the PTA Executive Board and Abingdon's administration
- Works with the Read-A-Thon vendor, which sends emails to parents and tracks students' reading
- Identifies and procures prizes for students
- Decorate and update a bulletin board which tracks the status of the Read-A-Thon

### 🌯 Spirit Night Coordinator

The PTA coordinates with a local restaurant so that a portion of their revenue on a particular evening will be donated to the PTA. The customers have to inform the restaurant at the time of purchase that they are participating in the Spirit Night so that a portion of their purchase goes to the PTA (this is important).

The Spirit Night Coordinator works with local restaurants to schedule the fundraiser, and works with the communications team to promote the event.

### 🤝 Sponsorships Coordinator

### 📖 Yearbook Coordinator

The PTA works with school officials to produce and distribute the Abingdon Yearbook each year.

The Yearbook Coordinator is in charge of creating the yearbook order form, tracking orders received, and formatting the LoveLines submitted by parents for publication in the yearbook. They are also expected to help with yearbook distribution once they are received.

### 🍅 Garden Coordinator

Abingdon Elementary has a garden along the southwest side of the school building. The goal of the garden is to enrich students' and families' knowledge of environmental sustainability and to be good stewards of our Earth, while providing first hand experience in learning about our food supply and our pollinators. More information can be found on the [garden page](/garden).

The Garden Coordinator works with Abingdon's Sustainability Coordinator (traditionally the science teacher) to organize garden cleanups, help with procuring seeds, and any other assistance. The Garden Coordinator maintains a list of community volunteers who may be called upon to help. Community volunteers are often enthusiastic about helping with the garden, particularly the local Master Gardeners. The garden is a great way to get the community invested in Abingdon's success.

### 🔔 After School Enrichment Coordinator

The After School Enrichment Coordinator serves as the liaison with Enrichment Matters to create the schedule for After-School Enrichment at Abingdon. They also work with the Abingdon Student Support Team to enroll students identified for scholarships (funded by the PTA) and ensure that the room reservation request forms for each session are completed.

### 🎨 Reflections Chair

Reflections is a national PTA-sponsored program that encourages students to express themselves artistically. Learn more about Reflections [on the National PTA's website](https://www.pta.org/home/programs/reflections).

The Reflections Chair organizes Abingdon's Reflections program by publicizing the program and recruiting volunteers to help judge the submissions. To make things easier, the National PTA publishes a "[Local Leader's Guide](https://www.pta.org/docs/default-source/files/programs/reflections/current_reflections-21-22/21-22_local-leaders-guide_reflections69c84cf1aa3e63899f67ff00009b2bd9.pdf)" which provides step-by-step instructions on how to manage the Reflections program. They also provide [a great deal of promotional material](https://www.pta.org/home/programs/reflections/startyourprogram) that our PTA can use to raise awareness of the program.

Due to a lack of volunteers, the Abingdon PTA has not participated in the Reflections program in several years. During the 2022-23 school year, we would like to bring back Reflections to Abingdon.

### 🏃‍♀️ Girls on the Run

Girls on the Run is a youth development program for girls in 3rd-8th grade. They teach life skills through dynamic interactive lessons and running games. The program culminates with the girls being physically and emotionally prepared to complete a celebratory 5K running event. The goal of the program is to unleash confidence through accomplishment while establishing a lifetime appreciation of health and fitness. 

Learn more about Girls on the Run on [their website](https://www.girlsontherun.org) and their [local Northern Virginia unit's website](https://gotrnova.org).

### 🧠 Odyssey of the Mind

The Odyssey of the Mind Coordinator organizes students' participation in a problem-solving and critical thinking competition. The competition encourages creativity and cooperation as teams of students work together to produce a "solution" to problems; these solutions generally involve putting on a skit that incorporates props, costumes, and even songs.

ACTL is made up of 40 to 50 individuals who are familiar with or interested in instructional issues. Thirteen curriculum-based / focused advisory committees report to the council annually. Serving on the ACTL is an excellent way to represent our school's interests and positively influence the school curriculum. Read more about ACTL [on their website](https://www.apsva.us/actl).
