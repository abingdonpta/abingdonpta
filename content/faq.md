# Frequently Asked Questions

## What is the PTA?

PTA stands for **P**arent **T**eacher **A**ssociation.

The Abingdon Elementary PTA is an active and enthusiastic group of parents and teachers working together to give our students the best possible educational and social experience during elementary school.

## What does the PTA do?

For over 70 years, Abingdon's PTA has supported Abingdon Elementary and the surrounding community by:

- Raising funds to provide food, clothing, and school supplies to families who cannot afford them
- Providing extra learning opportunities to children by organizing after-school classes, art contests, and other activities
- Organizing events that bring the community together
- Showing appreciation for our teachers with acts of kindness and generosity
- Encouraging parents to volunteer in classes and generally support staff wherever possible

## What is the time commitment?

It is completely up to you! We hold general committee meetings once per month that typically last one hour. If you elect to join a sub-committee and depending on the role, it may involve an additional 1-3 hours per activity (it all varies and can be further discussed as the opportunities arise).

## What type of role can I play to contribute as a functioning member of the PTA?

There are so many opportunities! There are roles for everyone, and it depends on your interests and skillset:
- **Technically savvy** - we can use help to update and manage our website, Facebook page, Twitter, meetings, etc.
- **Bilingual** - you can translate our communications
- **Organizer** - You can lead a committee or help plan an event
- **Just want to participate** - we have several events throughout the year and can use volunteers
- [Check out some of the roles listed here.](/leadership/) There are so many to choose from!

## Are there dues?
Annual dues are $5 per adult, but you can certainly contribute more. You don't have to be a dues-paying member to volunteer for the PTA or to attend meetings, but if you want to vote during meetings or be a PTA officer, you have to pay dues.

Dues can be submitted online, or via check or cash if necessary. [Click here for information about paying dues.](/membership/)
