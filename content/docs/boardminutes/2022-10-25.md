- No boundary changes

- Outdoor lunch needs? It's not an issue of tables, it's people. It's staffing. Not supposed to say that. Most lunches are running concurrently with recess. 130 kids on the playground. They will scarf down their food and run to play. It's a bit of a challenge. One of those things it's a nice treat, on a nice fall day, APS only gave us staffing for 10 extra lunch attendants, because that's what we needed. Would you welcome more picnic tables? Yes. They're great for the community. International Night for example.

- Field trips - last year, someone approached us who had donors through their work who wanted to fund Title I schools, and he came back to us and said you really do have money and want to know that the money is used for something that kids wouldn't have access to. We have fundraisers and people want to know where their money is going and they want a good story and sending 130 kids to Jamestown is a good story. Most schools use it for enrichment, and we can use it for scholarships for that with leftover money. Talked to Katie Kooiman, 4th grade team lead, phenominal, she has a date in mind, looked at prices for Jamestown settlement, it's 15 or 20 bucks when you take the bus out of it. John Foti. Middle of March, March 14, Tuesday before that, 6am to 6pm, early dismissal the day after would help everyone muddle through. People can pay full price or nothing. No one is around who planned it last time. Full price might be $70. Horak will send an email to Foti, Sharon, and Kooiman.

- School talk - I have a folder set up for me, we will send it to Ms. Tyson to put stuff in the folder for School Talk.

Kay also has a lot of money so now we have too much

5th grade swimming pool field trip? Apparently that's a thing. APS put the kibash on it because there was no instructional value

Clare: please ask your staff if they have field trip ideas

Maybe decorate windows? Sell windows? Building on Trunk or Treat each year. Pumpkins this year. APS transportation to pick up kids to bring them to school for trunk or treat? Have to fill out forms, have chaperones, older siblings... maybe I talked to the wrong person. Carlin Springs has provided transportation to families. Maybe a private bus company?

Lots of candy for AP's.

Food pantry is going well. Seeing what is being eaten.

Mice - I've heard from other families. we're not out of line with what other schools are experiencing. So we have to take care of the problem. I think pest control is coming tomorrow.

One second grade teacher was asking for snack donations. Some teachers aren't distributing snacks. Maybe have administrators reach out to their staff to make sure they understand the program and why we have it. Also the CT leads. Some teachers give it to them on their way out of school.

Farmer's Market - we have a table. We'll talk about the garden and the snack pantry to try to get extra hands. Also trying to get money. Also Harris Teeter signup. And Chipotle spirit night, social media promotion.

We have a new SEPTA liaison.

Reflections - 32 submissions

Extended Day - affects 6 Abingdon staff health insurance and sick leave. Going to lobby the superintendent and school board. It's all about budget - what are they budgeting? Meredith - we have to be bipartisan, don't know if we should get involved as a PTA. Ashley - maybe work with CCPTA if there is a position statement that comes out, we can sign on or not.

Movie Night - popcorn is free? Met up with Ms. Upshur, what are your expectations? Ms. Upshur never emailed her back except to say that there was a meeting in twenty minutes. We will try to do it for November 4. 

Meetings - people want to know how to volunteer and support, they were frustrated because the meeting ran long. Have people from the school, maybe have them after PTA business. Meeting is a way to put an exclamation point on stuff that goes home in Tuesday folder.

Trunk or Treat - 23 cars. We'd love to have more but it's still going to be fun and a nice day.

Reschedule next meeting to November 29

Grant requests 1-3 passed. 4 is tabled indefinitely due to other funding sources.

No stop sign cameras in VA, only in DC. Kiss & Ride is also terrible.
