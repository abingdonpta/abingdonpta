## Call to Order
The meeting was called to order at 8:00pm. Executive Board members in attendance:
- Sharon Burd, President
- Everyone

June 8, 2022 Executive Meeting Minutes were approved.

## Old Business

### Photo for a “Meet the Board” flier
- Send a photo to put a face to the name and build that relationship

### Abingdon PTA Staff Liaison(s) Needed
- We need a liaison to send out messages on our behalf, when we're trying to communicate with the staff.

### Recruiting for an after school enrichment coordinator for Baroody Camps
- Ad went out to get an afterschool enrichment coordinator. It'd be great to have someone in that role.
- Baroody handles our afterschool activities.
- Coordinator has rosters, accountability, knows what kids are walkers 3rd grade and above, which go back to extended day, has to be vetted by school. We reached out on social media. Ashley - it would be nice to reach out to staff.

## Family Engagement

### General Membership Meetings
- Generally 2nd Tuesdays at 7 pm. Confirmation pending CCPTA (Zoom interpretation account).
- September 13, October 11, November 8, December 13, January 10, February 21, March 14, April 11, May 9.

### Tuesday Folder Backpack Flyer - PTA Welcome Letter
- If anyone would like to draft a flyer explaining the PTA and asking people to join, let me know.

### Inaugural Cardinal Courier newsletter
- If you have content for the inaugural Cardinal Courier, let us know.
- Are the newsletters going to be the same format as before? Maybe a bit shorter and less dense than before.
- Maybe keep them shorter
- Maybe keep the website more up to date and promote it
- Tuesday folders were kind of a mess

### Reflections
- We intend to bring this back, pending CCPTA approval

### Girls on the Run
- We want to get this back. We need a liaison, it's usually a PTA member. But then we need coaches. Those can be either school-based teachers or community members. Ms. Muscarella has supported it in the past. Ms. Johndahl would like to help but doesn't want to take it on. Ashley can't take girls out running every Wednesday.
- Maybe ask Mr. Horak if there is a good staff contact

### School Directory (pending Mr. Horak’s approval)

### Multilingual WhatsApp Groups

### Speaking at the in-service
- Maybe we can get someone to speak to staff at the in-service

## Funding

### Treasurer’s Report
- Showed draft budget. Based on previous years, especially income.
- Not sure if we want to do armchair fundraiser - want to write a check to start out. Fall theme fundraiser ideas? Let us know.
- Spirit Gear - open an online store, we don't order things we don't need. We can bump up prices a bit if we want it to be a fundraiser
- Liquidating existing stock at upcoming events
- More fundraising
- Fundraising spreadsheet which shows which businesses we asked for money

## Ken updates
- Resource officers, not police officers
- School talk vs Everbridge, you'll get an alert if you sign up with Everbridge, maybe put up information on our website about Everbridge
- Translation - no response
- Visitor - what is that process? Local politician. No response.

### Budget line item requests
- May meet separately on budget to go over everything to make sure we're on the same page.
- Meeting Tuesday, 8/9 at 8 PM

### Audit
- We're required to perform an audit (financial review) each year. This is the first year we've done it in several years.
- Ours was approved by the Virginia PTA last week.
- Key takeaways:
    - Each transaction needs to have the documented approval of two signers - in our case, President and Treasurer. We are working on some kind of form or spreadsheet to document these approvals.
    - Each check needs to be signed by the President and Treasurer as well.
    - We need a receipt for every single transaction.

### Business partnership/donations

### Membership drive

### Existing spirit gear inventory

## Events

### PTA Closet Clean-up
- Friday, August 5, (1 pm)

### Abingdon Community Garden Clean-up & Harvest
- Sunday, August 7 (8:30 am-10:30 am)

### Kindergarten Popsicle Playdate
- Saturday, August 13 (9-11 am)

## Discussion

### Ms. Trenia Lynch’s laminator repair request

### Mr. Horak's Spirit Gear request
- Maybe just t-shirts for new teachers
- Do something cheaper for the in-service days

### Ms. Anne Oliveira’s August Columbia Pike popsicle playdate request
- Columbia Grove turned us down

### Mr. Horak’s landscaping request
- Traffic island. Water doesn't work on that side. Maybe native plants that don't need much care.
- Ashley: maybe we should plant bulbs? They grow year after year
- Tree almost fell on kids this year. There's another dead tree that needs to come down.
