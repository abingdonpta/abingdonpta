## Playground sail shades

Ashley and Sharon have been advocating for this since the tree left. Mr. Horak also talked about this. Sharon contacted the asst superintendent who looped in her colleague, Gerald. They are meeting with Gerald on Friday.

Horak is meeting with other principals on MCMM. Talking to principals about projects, if you have projects you get funded, this is how you do it. Also talked about more fencing around the campus. Put it on their radar and see what's going to happen. It's fine now but any hotter and the kids are sweaty. It's hot. Not even a chance for shade. This is a good time for this since they're just getting the budget process going. It might be til May. Can't fathom how much sail shades would cost. They ordered lunch tables and they were way, way more than what they expected. Meredith asked whether the PTA or someone else can fund it, if APS would approve it. Horak didn't know.

## Amphitheater, outdoor learning space

Also needs to happen under MCMM

Fencing around park, and around the big field - playing soccer right next to that bus turnaround.

## Dogs

Signs could be better. We're an open campus, which is nice. We've had to chase neighbors off the field during the school day. Want to be good neighbors but that's our property, from 7 til 6. Haven't noticed any repeat offenders after asking people to leave. Maybe put it in the community newsletter. People got used to using our field during COVID. But we're back normal and we need to get away from that. Also at pickup, we really need dogs to stay away. 600 kids being dismissed, you don't know who is having a bad day.

## Clubs

No cost associated with us. We just find a room and off we go. We have some laptops. Mostly used for testing. 3 or 4 laptop carts. Each have like 20 laptops. Talk to Molly Fisher about that. Reach out to her email address.

## Snack pantry

Megan - met with Stephanie Hopkins. Revamped process. Larger than we previously thought. Every student will have a snack every single day. It would be helpful to have these shipments come in ahead of time. Need storage. Mice like to chew through the cardboard boxes that they come in. We're trying to come up with a different solution. Possibly a metal cabinet.

Cafeteria and Extended Day might have spaces. Any storage space that's up? Like to order 2-4 weeks ahead of time. Can't do that until we have the room. Ordered 1/3 of what we need for a week to my house and it's a large box. Metal filing cabinets are not big enough. Megan will order one week's worth of food and bring it to the school and show Mr. Horak how large it is.

## Grants

Yes

## Field trips

Zeroed out that field trip budget. Everything is out of pocket. Yes, parents can pay for a certain amount, but for F&RL we find other funding. And Jamestown is a 4th grade field trip that's been historically done, but that's a significant investment, not sure we'll make it this year. Kindergarteners going to the zoo, 60 kids on a bus is pretty cheap. But anything that includes tickets gets a lot pricer. But we have a lot of free museums.

Are we fundraising for Jamestown trip? It's possible that no one on staff has even done it. Will ask JoLynn if there's a playbook. Trip is usually last couple of weeks in April. Claire: Claremont and Nottingham did it last year. There's a bus company we always use, so these things are set, we just need to get it going.

Conflict of interest if a business wants to support our school? Could be a good competition with businesses. Horak passes Garfield Elementary, Old Key Mill, they have like five banners with local businesses. I don't think it's a problem. Maybe the event is sponsored by a realtor, that's fine, we take your money and put your name up there.

## Odyssey of the mind

New staff members might take it on. Will share it. Teachers usually do it.

## October meeting

Put on the agenda - talk about the schoolwide plan to raise student test scores. Test scores don't look good. But we also have a tremendous amount of growth possible. But the numbers give us heartburn.

## Trunk or Treat

Still happening October 29. Not planning on Halloween parade. Don't want to take Wakefield band out of class, and I want to do something in the school. Also come in costumes, but no blow up dinosaur costumes. And they still want to bring candy to the apartment buildings.

Horak will check on Girls With Code, Odyssey of the Mind, Jamestown trip

Minutes were approved

Flyer coming to join the PTA

If you're a volunteer, make sure to sign in.

We need everyone to sign the meeting minutes to get the bank owners switched.

If you're CCPTA reps, please vote.

Dan: we're in good standing, 501c3

Megan spoke with Stephanie, it's much larger than she anticipated. We only got 20k out of 40k, she'll contact Amazon.

Winter coat drive - flyers going out on Peachjar this week. Flyers going out in Tuesday folder. The bin is set out but they are hoping to have a much larger bin. Put out a request for five volunteers every Thursday. And also want high school students to help.

Mr. Spadaro wants to do Boys Gotta Run

Want to sell car magnets at Trunk or Treat, just cash, still have a bit of old inventory

Our Harris Teeter numbers are off the charts, 80 people enrolled.

Box Tops for Education is a pain, no one has time to scan receipts.

Ken will talk to police outreach.

Ms. DeOlazo wants to speak. Could be helpful. Yes.

Put Reflections bin on PTA door

Trunk or Treat 12-2, 30 cars asking for, financially asking for a large undertaking, getting the word out there as quick as possible, let's get it in the Tuesday folder, and on the website and social media. Call for candy, it'll go to my house or at school. It would be nice to have the realtor sponsor 200 mini pumpkins, about $200 per pumpkin.

Kay was keen on meeting a need - shed, field trip. Greenstreet does it by their marketing office in Maryland, not store. Home Depot always gives. Lowe's gave me $150 last year.

We're doing a signup genius for handing out candy, a wishlist for buying candy. Meredith will ask Kay where she found pumpkins.

Chipotle - Claire filled out a form and provided our EIN. Glebe and Columbia Pike. Highest percentage donated - 33%. You have to bring the flyer. You can't hand out flyers outside. Bradlee Center &Pizza future possibility. Silver Diner maybe as well.

DEI wants to partner with us on movie night. Thursday November 3 is too close to Halloween, maybe try a different date. Sell big bags of popcorn from Costco, and slices of pizza from costco. 6-8 pm. DEI has four dates in mind. Need to email Ms. Upshur. Maybe do it on Friday instead of Thursday.

Sell stuff at Election Day

Split up staff grants into three roughly equal tranches

Steer classroom supplies into a published listing of wishlists
