## Call to Order

The virtual meeting was called to order at 8:00pm. Executive Board members in attendance:
- Sharon Burd, President
- Christian Lindstrom, Treasurer
- Clare Rosenberger, VP for Fundraising
- Meredith Greene, VP for Events
- Ashley Farrugia, VP for Staff Appreciation
- Dan Burd, Secretary

The board voted to approve the March 7 Executive Board Meeting Minutes.

## Nominating Committee
*Dan Burd*

Only three board positions have volunteers lined up so far for 2023-2024. The board discussed ways to improve recruitment, and the reasons why some were stepping down.

## Renewing Insurance
*Sharon Burd*

Sharon recommended that the PTA renew its insurance soon. This is especially important since a child was injured during the Book Fair after school had dismissed when books fell on top of them.

## Newsletter Vendor Change
*Dan Burd*

The PTA has changed from Constant Contact to Mailchimp for delivering its email newsletter, the Cardinal Courier. Expenses will go down from $45 to $22.51 monthly as a result, or a savings of approximately $270 annually. This includes Mailchimp's discount for tax-exempt organizations. Mailchimp offers the same apparent level of functionality as Constant Contact.

## International Night
*Meredith Greene*

- We are in a good place regarding planning right now.
- Meredith and/or Ashley reached out to Chris Willmore at Wakefield who connected them with people.
- Reid Goldstein intends to attend.
- We've got Brazilian Jiu Jitsu, Ukrainian dancers, and Double Dutch planned, as well as the chorus. There are also calls out to other folks, including at the high school.
- Art teachers will be doing crowns that people can draw and create.
- There will be henna too.
- We (Sharon?) will put together some kind of program.

## Staff Appreciation Week
*Ashley Farrugia*

- We will probably do charcuterie again, but without nuts.
- Perhaps free bagels from Einstein's for a bagel breakfast.
- We are trying to bring down the price of long sleeve tees.
- Looking into express manicures or chair massages.
- Perhaps also cakes from "Nothing But The Cakes."

## Staff Grants
*Dan Burd*

The Board voted unanimously in approval (by voice vote) of both staff grants for which the PTA received applications this period. This is the last staff grant period of the year. The grants are described in the table below.
