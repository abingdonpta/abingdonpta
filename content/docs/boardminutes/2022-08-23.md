August 4 meeting minutes approved

laminator - trina emailed asking whether we are buying film. Old one doesn't have film so we don't know if it works.

We will appropriate $1500 for the year for laminator film, while providing notice that this is the last year that we are providing funds for this.

Staff grants - approved. We will stagger the approvals in some way

i wonder if we can also get some more specificity - than "description of request"
to include need it will serve, data or whatever that explains that need, purpose, benefit, outcome, or
something like that - description of request is just very vague

Back to school night babysitting - backburner. Megan will follow up with the national honor society about babysitting

Amazon $40k grant for snacks for students - to distrbute to classrooms. Has to be used for snacks. Part of a larger donation to local schools and organizations.

Budget - we will vote by email about it when it's ready.

Christian explained the expense authorization form. Virginia PTA requirement

Dan explained the 501c3

Clare would like to apply for a mini-grant for safe routes to school. Not sure how competitive it is but it seems straightforward.

Lifetouch - we will reach out to ask for lists of families who ordered class photos.

Volunteer opportunities

Sail shades - we will advocate for APS to pay for this. The back playground is too exposed. We will look for good prices and stay in touch with Mr. Horak about it.

K-cups - let's do a fundraiser for it.

Open house - as many board members will volunteer to staff the table as possible.

back to school - ask Horak to remind families to bring supplies to the open house.

Volunteer form - check it out

Spirit Wear - email conversation about orders and pricing
