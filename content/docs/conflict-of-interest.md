## Article I

#### Purpose

The purpose of the conflict of interest policy is to protect Abingdon Elementary PTA's interest when it is contemplating entering into a transaction or arrangement that might benefit the private interest of an officer of the PTA or might result in a possible excess benefit transaction. This policy is intended to supplement but not replace any applicable state and federal laws governing conflict of interest applicable to nonprofit and charitable organizations.

## Article II

#### Definitions

**1. Interested Person**

Any member of the Executive Board or any committee who has a direct or indirect financial interest, as defined below, is an interested person.

**2. Financial Interest**

A person has a financial interest if the person has, directly or indirectly, through business, investment, or family:

1. An ownership or investment interest in any entity with which the PTA has a transaction or arrangement,
1. A compensation arrangement with the PTA or with any entity or individual with which the PTA has a transaction or arrangement, or
1. A potential ownership or investment interest in, or compensation arrangement with, any entity or individual with which the PTA is negotiating a transaction or arrangement.
1. Compensation includes direct and indirect remuneration as well as gifts or favors that aren’t insubstantial. A financial interest isn’t necessarily a conflict of interest. Under Article III, Section 2, a person who has a financial interest may have a conflict of interest only if the Executive Board decides that a conflict of interest exists.

## Article III

#### Procedures

**1. Duty to Disclose**

In connection with any actual or possible conflict of interest, an interested person must disclose the existence of the financial interest and be given the opportunity to disclose all material facts to the Executive Board or to the Committee Chair considering the proposed transaction or arrangement.

**2. Determining Whether a Conflict of Interest Exists**

After disclosure of the financial interest and all material facts, and after any discussion with the interested person, he/she shall leave the Executive Board or committee while the determination of a conflict of interest is discussed and voted upon. The remaining Executive Board or committee members shall decide if a conflict of interest exists.

**3. Procedures for Addressing the Conflict of Interest** 

1. An interested person may make a presentation at the Executive Board or committee meeting, but after the presentation, he/she shall leave the meeting during the discussion of, and the vote on, the transaction or arrangement involving the possible conflict of interest.
1. The chairperson of the Executive Board or committee shall, if appropriate, appoint a disinterested person or committee to investigate alternatives to the proposed transaction or arrangement.
1. After exercising due diligence, the Executive Board or committee shall determine whether the PTA can obtain, with reasonable efforts, a more advantageous transaction or arrangement from a person or entity that would not give rise to a conflict of interest.
1. If a more advantageous transaction or arrangement isn’t reasonably possible under circumstances not producing a conflict of interest, the Executive Board or committee shall determine by a majority vote of the disinterested directors whether the transaction or arrangement is in the PTA's best interest, for its own benefit, and whether it is fair and reasonable. In conformity with the above determination, it shall make its decision as to whether to enter into the transaction or arrangement.

**4. Violations of the Conflict of Interest Policy**

1. If the Executive Board or committee has reasonable cause to believe a member has failed to disclose actual or possible conflicts of interest, it shall inform the member of the basis for such belief and afford the member an opportunity to explain the alleged failure to disclose.
1. If, after hearing the member's response and after making further investigation as warranted by the circumstances, the Executive Board or committee determines the member has failed to disclose an actual or possible conflict of interest, it shall take appropriate disciplinary and corrective action.

## Article IV

#### Records of Proceedings

The minutes of the Executive Board and all committees shall contain:

1. The names of the persons who disclosed or otherwise were found to have a financial interest in connection with an actual or possible conflict of interest, the nature of the financial interest, any action taken to determine whether a conflict of interest was present, and the Executive Board's or committee's decision as to whether a conflict of interest in fact existed.
1. The names of the persons who were present for discussions and votes relating to the transaction or arrangement, the content of the discussion, including any alternatives to the proposed transaction or arrangement, and a record of any votes taken in connection with the proceedings.

## Article V

#### Annual Statements

Any member of the Executive Board shall annually sign a statement which affirms such person:

1. Has received a copy of the conflict of interest policy,
1. Has read and understands the policy,
1. Has agreed to comply with the policy, and
1. Understands the PTA is charitable and in order to maintain its federal tax exemption it must engage primarily in activities that accomplish one or more of its tax-exempt purposes.
