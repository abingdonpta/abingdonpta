Develop a growth mindset

Gifted referral process - more on that in January and February

Q: If a student has a better reading level, how does the teacher address it?
A: We're in a new language arts curriculum, and the county is helping us look at the data, their needs will be met either by the classroom teacher or a specialist. Worked in a book club with students who read at an advanced level. Match texts to interests. Also students can sometimes read quite high but can't comprehend deeply without sufficient background experience.

Q: Can you address any opportunities or less formal strategies that are employed in kindergarten classrooms? Thank you!
A: Did some CCTC or ??? trainings in the classroom. Many of those are now digitally provided to teachers. Also been approached by teachers to provide material for students performing above grade level.

presentation ended at 7:55.

It's October. What I wanted to do tonight is talk about our school plan and talk about our student achievement and what we're going to do to raise our test scores. We have many ways that we determine student success - most important for me is are the students excited and learning.

Tier 2 accredition status - due to the gap between our past rate in math and the scores ?? for students with disabilities. Students with disabilities scored lower than the overall pass rate.

Science is lower because it's only 5th graders take the test but it's on 4th and 5th grade curriculum.

There was a big drop during COVID, and we're aligned with other schools in the country in having a performance drop.

We make progress by morning cardinals, social emotional learning, CETA partnership, interventionists, structured literacy. FUNdations phonics program.

I could talk about data all night. When you look at data, it tells one story. I wish all of our students passed our tests each year but that is not the case. I think our teachers do a remarkable job teaching our students. We anticipate a huge jump in scores this year now that they have two full years of in-person teaching under their belts. Learning is going to take place once they feel that Abingdon is the place for them, and they'll work hard for the teachers who love them.

Q: How to support EL
A: One EL teacher per grade level, and two teachers that work in multiple grade levels. Their job is to work with those students who are EL, and modify curriculum for those needs. All of our staff need to be culturally proficient in how to reach out to those kids.
A: FACE is also working on this.
A: Also we send out information in multiple languages. Also, language line.

Q: Which scores need to rise and how much?
A: The gap has to close. Gap is 39%, gap has to close by 10%. Need a 26% gap.

Q: Dogs - what's going on
A: Fairlington is dog-friendly, Abingdon is not. Abingdon is for students. Safety and Security office will also stick their heads out.

Q: Outdoor lunch?
A: We had more staffing last year. We have to have a certain number of adults per student. It's dependent on staffing, days of the week, a lot of things have to line up. But teachers have done that to reward classes.

Q: Pedestrian safety - a student was almost hit recently
A: Talked to Dr. Mayo about it. I don't have control over but I've had a conversation about it.
