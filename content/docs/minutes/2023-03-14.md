- We've raised almost $8,700 already for the Read-a-thon, and we're already at 29,000 minutes.
- Having someone read to a student counts, and having the student read to someone else (stuffed animal, dog) also counts.

- There will be a winning class per grade this year.

### Questions and Answers

**Q**: What is Morning Meeting like?

responsible, assertive, and kind.)
- Third grade swimming is coming up the week before Spring Break and the week after Spring Break.
- Fifth graders will stay overnight at the Outdoor Lab on the first week of May.
- For standardized testing: third graders take math and reading, fourth graders take math, reading, and Virginia Studies, and fifth graders take reading and science.
- Students are very excited for Read-a-thon.
- Safety and security continue to be a priority. APS was communicative on the recent lockdown at Gunston which was very helpful.
- We had a Tornado drill today. We also have frequent fire drills.
- The trainer for Fundations, our phonics program, said that we were "killing it."

### Questions and Answers

**Q**: Wakefield PTA President Judith Davis asked in February if she could come and do a quick DEIA presentation, but I think our speakers are full for March and April.  
**A**: Yes, we have a speaker for April and May will be our election meeting.

**Q**: Responsive classroom and social-emotional learning are very important.

**Q**: Car drop off is getting wild, though I have no solutions. Cars are cutting in front of each other and going through the handicapped spots. Perhaps a pointed email would help. Mr. Michael is doing a great job.  
**A**: It's an awkward parking lot. And we have 750 kids who need to enter the building in 20 minutes, and we've got to work together to do that.

## Adjournment
