## Principal's Report
*David Horak, Principal*  
*Anne Oliveira, Assistant Principal*  
*Michele Michael, Assistant Principal*

The principals introduced themselves. Each serves as the first point of contact for administrative support for two grades: Mr. Horak for 2nd and 3rd grade, Ms. Oliveira for 1st and 5th grade, and Mr. Michael for kindergarten and 4th grade.

Mr. Horak said that the start of the school year has been lovely compared to the last two school years which were strongly influenced by COVID.

The Abingdon mission was changed this year. It is listed on [the school's webpage](https://abingdon.apsva.us/about-us/our-school/). It is the global vision for what Abingdon hopes to accomplish. The new mission is:

> Abingdon builds meaningful relationships by fostering an inclusive environment throughout our community. We are committed to challenging and empowering all learners.

He added that the new staff this year match that vision. The staff turnover at Abingdon was similar to other schools, but the new staff has integrated well and the existing staff has been very welcoming.

Ms. Oliveira said that there are many drills in the beginning of the year, including fire drills, lockdown drills, an earthquake drill and a tornado drill. These are mandatory as they are written into the [Virginia Code](https://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacodefull/title22.1/chapter9/article2/). She said that the staff try to ensure that the students understand that it's just practice, and that it's something that keeps everyone safe. She said that if anyone has concerns, [they can reach out to her](mailto:anne.oliveira@apsva.us).

Additional points:
- Mr. Horak stressed that instruction starts at Abingdon at 7:50 AM. Students need to be in the classroom at that time.
- He asked families who need free or reduced lunch to [sign up for it](https://www.myschoolapps.com/Application).
- Students are currently taking tests now, as there are assessments at the beginning of the year to see where students are.
- Mr. Michael stated that kids have adjusted rather well and were happy to return to school.
- He also stated that the school was planning to recognize kids and staff for their efforts, which we would hear about soon.

### Questions and Answers

**Q: Will students go on any field trips outside of Arlington? For instance, we have a partnership with the Kennedy Center.**  
A: Mr. Horak stated that APS has said that anything that's not directly associated with Arlington is not allowed, which includes a trip to the Kennedy Center. He stated that the Outdoor Lab is fine, as well as swimming and the planetarium. He also stated there also has to be funding attached to it and that he was not sure that there was funding.

**Q: Is there any chance of continuing outdoor lunch?**  
A: Mr. Horak stated that the school can definitely can have outdoor lunch, and said that it could serve as a class reward. He said the school is "getting our feet back under us" in terms of having the kids back in the cafeteria, but then he said they could resume outdoor lunch. He opined that it's nice to eat outside in the fall.

**Q: Have there been any curriculum changes this year?**  
A: Mr. Horak said that Abingdon's framework for literacy instruction is new. [Virginia mandated "Structured Literacy" this year](https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?221+ful+SB616), which is different from [Teacher's College](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teachers_College_Reading_and_Writing_Project) which had been done before at Abingdon. He stated that Virginia has gone this way for a few reasons, including that phonics and phonemic awareness have been shown to have a more balanced impact. He said in addition to the new literacy framework, there's also a new curriculum to learn. He opined that it's a lot to learn and a lot for staff members to take on.

Mr. Horak said that there is a new set of resources for math, but not a new curriculum. He said that he expected staff to get better and better as they dive in and learn. He said that Abingdon had provided feedback that they wanted a more structured literacy approach, and that APS heard that feedback.

**Q: Now that iPads aren't being sent home, what do I do if my child receives a positive COVID test? Should I alert the teacher and get his ipad?**  
A: Mr. Horak stated that parents need to report positive COVID tests to the clinic. He said that a COVID-positive student stays at home for five days and then wears a mask for another five days. He explained that there is no contact tracing unless there's an outbreak to see if there are linkages to other classrooms. Abingdon continues to have opt-in testing every week. He said that, at this point, we're learning to live with COVID. He concluded by saying that kids who aren't feeling well can stay home, but that the school isn't sending home kids who have a runny nose.
