## Introduction of Officers

All of the officers (President, Vice Presidents, Treasurer and Secretary) took turns introducing themselves to the general membership.

## Principal's Report
*David Horak, Principal*  
*Anne Oliveira, Assistant Principal*  
*Michele Michael, Assistant Principal*

The principals introduced themselves. Each serves as the first point of contact for administrative support for two grades: Mr. Horak for 2nd and 3rd grade, Ms. Oliveira for 1st and 5th grade, and Mr. Michael for kindergarten and 4th grade.

Mr. Horak said that the start of the school year has been positive compared to the last two school years which were strongly influenced by COVID.

The Abingdon mission was changed this year. It is listed on [the school's webpage](https://abingdon.apsva.us/about-us/our-school/). The new mission is:

> Abingdon builds meaningful relationships by fostering an inclusive environment throughout our community  We are committed to challenging and empowering all learners.

Michele Michael, 3rd year, K and 4th grade
Anne Oliveira, 4th year, 1st grade and 5th grade
Horak working with second and third grade
They are the first point of contact for administrative support
Start of the school year has been quite lovely as opposed to the past school years. Feels more like school.
Changed the Abingdon vision this year. Worked with staff leaders to do that. It's the global vision of what we want to do at Abingdon. It's on the webpage, at the About Us

There's a lot of intentionality and a lot of thought. We're going to get to know each other and that's how we're going to learn.
Doesn't say students - community and learners. Community should see themselves in that vision. Staff definitely.
Working towards a more inclusive community, a more perfect union.
The staff we brought on match that vision. We had some staff turnover but similar to other schools. New staff has really integrated themselves into the community. Existing staff has been very welcoming.
New start time - 7:50 AM. First week might have been a wakeup call for some people. That's when instruction starts. The bell rings, we say the pledge of allegiance, and have a moment of silence, and instruction starts at 7:51 AM. And this week there were several students out there at that time. Morning meeting is starting at that time. We open doors at 7:30 but at 7:50 we're ready to go.
If you qualify for free and reduced lunch, that signup was waived for the last couple of years, but if you need it or if you know someone who needs it, please sign up for it. I wish they had continued the free lunch from the COVID era and maybe the politicians will change that.
Students are taking tests. They're doing it in an age-appropriate way. There are assessments at the beginning of the year to see where students are. But they are learning, routines and such.
Michele - kids have adjusted rather well. They felt that coming back to school was really great. A lot of uplifting moments and positivity. We are planning things to recognize kids for their efforts, which you'll hear about soon, as well as staff.
Oliveira - there are also a lot of drills at the beginning of the year. Fire drills, lockdown drills. It's in the Virginia code, we have to do them - once per month, but the first month it's more intense. A couple of lockdown drills later in the year. And an earthquake drill and a tornado drill. But we try to make sure that the kids understand that it's just practice, and it's something that keeps us safe. If you have any concerns, please reach out.

Q: Any trips elsewhere?
A: APS has said that anything that's not directly associated with Arlington is not allowed, like a trip to the Kennedy Center. Outdoor Lab is fine, swimming, planetarium is good. There also has to be funding attached to it and I'm not sure that there is.

Q: Any chance of continuing outdoor lunch?
A: We definitely can have outdoor lunch, getting the staff out there, those tables are still there. Might be a class reward, we're able to do them, we're getting our feet back under us, in terms of having the kids back in the cafeteria, but then let's get the kids out there.

Q: Literacy instruction?
A: Framework for literacy instruction is new. Math curriculum is new too. There's the reading wars. Structured literacy by the state of VA - small group time and the way it's delivered is different from what had been done before, which is Teacher's College workshop. VA has gone this way for a few reasons. Phonics, phonemic awareness has shown more balanced impact. There's a new literacy framework, but also a new curriculum to learn. It's a lot to learn, it's a lot for staff members to take on.
And then with math, it's a new set of resources, not a new curriculum. We just need to dive into them and learn them, and as we go we'll keep getting better and better. It's definitely on our mind, how to best deliver literacy and math instruction. And our feedback has been to want CQLA a more structured literacy approach, and APS heard us.

Q: We're not doing the pre-emptive sending ipads home, is there a great reference to learn about whether we have a positive COVID test? Should I alert the teacher and get his ipad?
A: Need to report COVID positive tests into the clinic. Five days at home and then you wear a mask for five days. No contact tracing unless there's an outbreak to see if there are linkages to other classrooms. We still have the opt-in testing every week. At this point we're learning to live with it - how to manage. Kids who aren't feeling well can stay home, but we aren't sending home kids who have a runny nose.

## PTA Updates

### Treasurer's Report
*Christian Lindstrom*

Budget - looks a lot like last year. Hoping to spend about $40,000 on everything.

We've earned about $4112, most of which was yearbook payments, and spent about 3334, much of which was scholarships for enrichment.

### Staff Appreciation
*Ashley Farrugia*

Trying to be active at the begnning of the year. We had an ice cream truck come at teacher's week. We've given bagels to the teachers two times now. Lucky that Einstein's has partnered with us and given us freebies. Coming up, some things in the fall, we provided either a breakfast or lunch for conferences. Lots of appreciation for schools, from clinic staff to librarians to AA's, we're just looking for volunteers to help with events. And then our biggest week which is teacher's appreciation week.

### Events
*Meredith Greene*

Thanks for everyone who got a sunburn and sweated it out with us. And for the kids to catch up with another. Fun cornhole spraypainting. I think we'll stick with similar to events with what we did last year. Something like trunk or treat. Winter, international, please volunteer.

### After School Enrichment
*Ken Venable*

Kind of a rush, we'll do it faster for the next two sessions. Heavy on engineering, that's my thing, that's where the jobs are.

### Fall Fundraising
*Clare Rosenberger*

Join, HT link, we're doing spirit nights soon at local restaurants. Let me know if you have any favorite restaurants. We love local businesses. Reaching out to small businesses in the community for projects that they can sponsor. Let them know if you have one or your neighbor has one. We'll have a meet and greet with small businesses to find a way to work with them. If you have ideas, please reach out, we'd love to chat.
