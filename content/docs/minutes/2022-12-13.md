### Staff Appreciation
*Ashley Farrugia, VP for Staff Appreciation*

Ashley stated that the teachers appreciate some of the bigger things that the PTA has done so she is trying to spread out the appreciation activities so that the PTA has can get more "bang for the buck." She intends to organize a Valentine's Day event where the PTA can provide some love to the teachers. Ashley is looking for businesses with whom the PTA could partner to get discounted goodies for teachers, as well as families who can come in to the school to help set up appreciation events. Ashley provided her email address to reach out for ideas and to help support appreciation activities: ashleybethmccarthy@gmail.com

### Educational Programs

Enrollment for winter enrichment classes opened up this week, and parents have pounced on it. In the spring, the PTA intends to have three classes per day, as well as potentially a Friday class as well.

Ken also spoke about his advocacy for Abingdon's Extended Day team, which is understaffed while there is a backlog of families who would like to sign up for the program.

### Fundraising
*Sharon Burd, President, in place of Clare Rosenberger, VP for Fundraising*
