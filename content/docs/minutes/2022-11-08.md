Welcome by Ms. Oliveira and translation instructions by Christian

Mr Michael

New staff members who joined us. New instructional assistant elsi who is working with special needs students. Also Darcia, one of our math interventionists, working with students, pushing in doing small groups working iwth math coaches

New 4th grade teacher, we lost Ms. Ortiz, we are excited to have Amanda Smiley to join us, she came by last week to meet the kids, yesterday was her first day, we're all supporting her, they are welcoming her. Great additions to us.

We are now doing grade level assemblies on a quarterly basis. Recognizing students for their efforts. Being safe, kind, responsible, so that they understand schoolwide expectations, how they work with other kids and staff, huge success, kids were recognized with wristbands and certificates.

Ms. Oliveira

We're in the middle of the COGAT test, universal screener, primarily happening in second grade, but if students are new to the school and the system and they're in 3 4 or 5 so they would do it as well. It takes us awhile - 2nd is a big grade. Doesn't inform report card, not knowledge based - more ability base. We use it to identify gifted.

Trunk or treat was huge success - we did road show so we didn't have the sense of being there but we were there setting up and it looked amazing. Pumpkin decorating, also wristband decoration from art teacher. Road show part was fun, Mr michael and I got to dress up a bit and pass out some candy.

Mr. Michael

Movie night in the gym. Coco. Huge hit. ushering out after the pandemic, bringing families into the building. Must have been 200 people. Parents, grandparents, sleeping bags. Great to see the huge turnout.

We're also doing our mentoring program. Any staff member within the building who wants to mentor a student no matter the grade level need. We're having our breakfast tomorrow with our mentees. Staff can check in on their mentees so that they know they have a trusted adult who can talk with them and check in with them. Kids have varying needs and need support so having someone outside that classroom teacher to work on the whole child is pretty exciting.

Q: Who serves as mentors?
A: It's staff in the building. They are available throughout the day to drop in and check in. To engage in meaningful and trusting conversations. And we communicate with the parents to discuss how it's going. And it requires parental approval to participate.

Q: Drip in the ceiling?
A: It's fine. Custodians replaced the ceiling tile. Thank you to everyone for walking around it and fixing it.

Meeting minutes were approved.

Christian provided the financial report.

Meredith - trunk or treat. Thank you for going over to the other neighborhoods. Thank you to volunteers

Winter Wonderland in January. We're more inclined to have more things inside this year but we'll see how things go. Hoping for weather like last year.

Staff appreciation. We did lunches for staff. Jersey Mike's gave us a nice discount. We think the staff appreciated it. Thank you to all of the volunteers.

Ken

We had some challenges with enrichment programs. But this time it'll be smoother. Registration will open in December. And close registration for 6 January for the next week's classes. No lottery. First come first serve. And some teachers will host programs too. Also I'm a 5th grade basketball coach for girls, we're the flying squirrels.

Clare

Great Chipotle night. Brought in $580. Great to see people. Very generous profit share. We're hoping to do more of these. If anyone has connections or suggestions, let us know. I'd like to do Five Guys, District Taco. Great to have a takeout as well as sit in. Also, Mabel's Labels instructions for a fundraising campaign for labels for those jackets or sweatshirts. Those will go out via email and Tuesday folders.

We're interested in having a small business meet and greet with the PTA in january. Many small businesses in Abingdon's attendance zone who want to help. Ms. Upshur has an amazing outdoor classroom idea. So we have a lot of possibilities, in kind or otherwise, for donations. So if you or a neighbor has a small business and wants to connect with the school, either time or money.

Field trips aren't funded by APS, except for planetarium and outdoor lab. Working with donors to support field trips. Talking ti Ms. Kooiman to get the 4th graders to Jamestown. We want to make sure that happens.
We always ask for help with translation. We have several volunteers for Spanish translation. We also need assistance with other languages. Amharic, Arabic and Mongolian we need assistance. Language Line only supports pertinent documents like IEP's. I've reached out to APS Face coordinator. We need the translation support for our families for whom English is not their first language.
Our science teacher Ms. Upshur is working with our 5th grade teachers to design an outdoor classroom. She's working with students to design something in its place and coordinating with the think lab at wakefield. Connected her with Clark Construction volunteer to work with contractors and subcontractors with donating. Drop me a message.
