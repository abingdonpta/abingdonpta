        1. We may need to raise annual membership dues from $5 due to the National PTA proposal to raise their cut from $2.25 to $4 per member. Currently the Virginia PTA also takes $1.50 per member, the CCPTA takes $0.25 per member, and credit card processing (stripe + Memberhub) takes $0.50 + 3.5% so we need to not lose money on dues. Most Arlington PTA’s charge at least $10 per member per year.
