## Current Logos

The PTA requested and obtained the current Abingdon Cardinal logo from an APS graphic designer in December 2021.

At around the same time, a PTA volunteer created the PTA logo below, made to look like the [original logo provided by the Virginia PTA](https://www.vapta.org/images/logos/A/abingdonelem.jpg) but at a better resolution and with improved cropping.

## Old Logos
