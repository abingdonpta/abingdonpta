## Current Cardinal Logos

The PTA requested and obtained the current Abingdon Cardinal logo from an APS graphic designer (Sara Daniel) in December 2021.

## Current PTA Logo

A PTA volunteer (Dan Burd) created the PTA logo below in 2022, made to look like the [original logo provided by the Virginia PTA](https://www.vapta.org/images/logos/A/abingdonelem.jpg) but at a better resolution and with improved cropping.

## Old Cardinal Logos

A PTA volunteer (Vickie Spindler) created the two Abingdon Cardinal logos below in September 2014. They were used for Spirit Gear in subsequent years.

## Original Cardinal Logo

The 2014 logos above were based off of a design used by a T-shirt company to create Spirit Gear for the PTA sometime between 2011 and 2014, although either the company either wouldn't provide the logo file or the PTA didn't request it. That, in turn, was based off of a "thumbs up" cardinal image from the website iStock, which the PTA (Andrew Vitols) purchased from iStock in September 2014 in order to ensure that the PTA had the rights to it before creating the logo files above. (There are other schools that use this logo - they presumably got it from iStock rather than copying Abingdon.)

## Abingdon GIFT Logos

Project GIFT originated sometime before 2007, when it stood for "Gaining Instruction, Fostering Talents." The logo originated in September 2010, along with the slogan "Integrating Arts with Multiple Smarts." Between 2013 and 2014, GIFT changed to mean "Guiding Instruction through Fine Arts and Technology." The logo changed to reflect this. Both logos are below. It's not clear where the original vector files for these logos are, nor is it clear who made the logos. *Traditionally the school uses this logo, not the PTA.*

## CETA Logo

Abingdon participates in the CETA (Changing Education through the Arts) program with the Kennedy Center. We might use this logo for a meeting flyer once in awhile. No known vector file exists for this logo.
