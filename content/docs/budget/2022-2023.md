## 💵 Fundraising

### 🪙 Membership Dues

We had 180 members last year, each of whom paid $5 in membership dues, for a total of $900 in revenue.

### 💵 Donations

We received about $1,000 in donations last year.

### 📚 Read-a-Thon

We received about $19,000 in revenue from Read-a-Thon last year. We also incurred a few expenses, which were mostly rewards for classes who read a lot.

### 👕 Spirit Gear

We haven't ordered or sold Spirit Gear in years.

### 📸 School Pictures

We received about $3,000 from the photography vendor for facilitating school photos last year.

### 🛍️ Mixed bags

We received about $1,500 from the Mixed Bags fundraiser last year.

### 📖 Yearbooks

We received about $1,000 in yearbook sales last year, while spending about $4,000 to have the yearbooks printed.

### 💸 Retail Rebates

We received about $400 from our retail rebates last year, which was entirely from Harris Teeter "Together in Education." We'd like to promote that more heavily this year, and add Amazon Smile once our tax exemption is reinstated.

### ✏️ EduKit

### 🌯 Spirit Nights

## 🎓 Educational Programs

### 🔔 After School Enrichment Scholarships

We would like to provide after-school enrichment classes to students whose families would not otherwise be able to afford such classes. This expense was budgeted last year but never spent.

### 🍅 Garden

We would like to financially support our school garden to ensure that it has sufficient supplies. These include tools, seeds, and potting soil. This is a new line-item - the garden was generously supported by donations last year, but we could do more with a dedicated funding stream.

### 🧰 Garden Shed

The school garden currently has no shed. Tools and other supplies are vulnerable to theft and exposure to the elements. We would like to buy a shed as soon as possible to protect our garden tools.

### 🎭 School Play

Abingdon teacher Ms. Kerry Abbott puts on a wonderful school play every spring. Last year we purchased costumes for the play, which cost about $725. We have earmarked a similar amount for this year.

### 👨‍👦 Cardinal Kids Mentoring Program

The Cardinal Kids Mentoring Program matches students with staff members. The goals of the program are to build school connections, support academic success, increase self-esteem, and have fun. The funds expended last year - about $450 - was mostly spent on food and t-shirts for mentoring events. The program is managed by Ms. Caty Branco, Abingdon's bilingual parent liaison.

### 🌼 Hispanic Heritage Month

The PTA funds a breakfast each year that celebrates Hispanic Heritage Month. We spent about $250 last year on this and we've budgeted a similar amount this year.

### 🎨 Art Supplies

The PTA occasionally pays for art supplies when needs arise. We spent $200 on art supplies last year and we've budgeted a similar amount this year.

### 🎨 Reflections

We'd like to restart the [Reflections art program](/reflections/) this year. The money budgeted for this program will likely go to awards and certificates for participating students.

### 💦 Field Day

Abingdon's physical education teachers organize an excellent Field Day every spring, in which students participate in a number of fun outdoor activities. The PTA spent about $100 to support this event last year, and we've budgeted a similar amount for this year.


## 🏫 Staff Grant Fund

The [Staff Grant Fund](/grants/) is new this year. Funds are intended to directly benefit as many students as possible. This allows us to identify new, worthwhile expenditures as the school year progresses.

### ☎️ Student Directory

This is a new expense as we have not had a student directory in several years. The funds will go to a vendor who will make a student directory available online to the Abingdon community.

### ⛈️ Insurance

We are required by the state PTA to have an insurance policy. We spent about $180 on insurance last year, and we have budgeted a similar amount for this year.

### 💲 Transaction Fees

The PTA pays transaction fees for accepting credit cards. For point-of-sale credit card swipes we use a Square reader, which charges us $0.30 plus 2.90% of the total transaction. For online sales we use Stripe and Memberhub, which together charge us $0.50 plus 3.50% of the total transaction. (Transaction fees for online sales are not necessarily tallied as expenses because the funds are never in our bank account, but we try to remain conscious of transaction fees nonetheless.)

### 🖥️ Website

We spent about $300 on the website last year, and $220 for registration of our web domains. Our new website costs nothing and we've lowered our domain registration costs to $20 anually by choosing a new vendor.
