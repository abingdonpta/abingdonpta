## 💵 Fundraising

### 🪙 Membership Dues

We had 180 members last year, each of whom paid $5 in membership dues, for a total of $900 in revenue. We expect a similar number of members this year.

### 💵 Donations

We received about $1,000 in donations last year.

### 🍂 Fall Fundraiser

These are the potential revenues for a yet-to-be-determined fall fundraiser.

### 📚 Read-a-Thon

We received about $19,000 in revenue from Read-a-Thon last year. We also incurred a few expenses, which were mostly rewards for classes who read a lot.

### 👕 Spirit Gear

Spirit Gear is clothing and accessories with the Abingdon Cardinal logo, like t-shirts and car magnets. We haven't ordered Spirit Gear in years, but we intend to do so this year.

### 📸 School Pictures

These are funds we receive from our photography vendor for facilitating school photos last year. We can expect to receive about $5,000 for this year's photos, plus about $2,000 from last year's photos which is arriving late.

### 🛍️ Mixed bags

The "Mixed Bags" fundraiser is also known as the Boon Supply fundraiser - funds raised from a mail-order catalog program. We received about $1,500 from this fundraiser last year.

### 📖 Yearbooks & Lovelines

We received about $1,000 in yearbook sales last year, while spending about $4,000 to have the yearbooks printed. We intend to sell Lovelines this year (messages from families within the yearbook) to help offset the cost.

### 💸 Retail Rebates

Retail rebates are programs like Harris Teeter's "Together in Education" and AmazonSmile in which community members "link" their accounts with the PTA, which receives a portion of money spent at the vendor. We intend to start up AmazonSmile once our tax exemption is reinstated.

### ✏️ EduKit

Edukit offers prepackaged school supplies that are tailored to meet the needs of each grade at Abingdon Elementary. The PTA receives a portion of sales.

### 🌯 Spirit Nights

Spirit Nights are scheduled by the PTA at select restaurants and businesses in our area during which they donate a percentage of proceeds back to the PTA. We have not done this for awhile but we intend to do so once our tax exemption is reinstated.


## 🎓 Educational Programs

### 🔔 After School Enrichment Scholarships

We intend to continue providing after-school enrichment classes to students whose families would not otherwise be able to afford such classes.

### 🍅 Garden

We would like to financially support our school garden to ensure that it has sufficient supplies. These include tools, seeds, and potting soil. This is a new line-item - the garden was generously supported by donations last year, but we could do more with a dedicated funding stream.

Part of this funding is intended to pay for a shed. The school garden currently has no shed. Tools and other supplies are vulnerable to theft and exposure to the elements. We would like to buy a shed as soon as possible to protect our garden tools.

### 🎭 School Play

Abingdon teacher Ms. Kerry Abbott puts on a wonderful school play every spring. Last year we purchased costumes for the play, which cost about $725. We have earmarked a similar amount for this year.

### 👨‍👦 Cardinal Kids Mentoring Program

The Cardinal Kids Mentoring Program matches students with staff members. The goals of the program are to build school connections, support academic success, increase self-esteem, and have fun. The funds expended last year were mostly spent on food and t-shirts for mentoring events. The program is managed by Ms. Caty Branco, Abingdon's bilingual parent liaison.

### 🌼 Hispanic Heritage Month

The PTA funds a breakfast each year that celebrates Hispanic Heritage Month.

### 🎨 Art Enrichment

The PTA pays for a few art-related needs:
- Supplementary supplies for art classrooms
- [The Reflections program](/reflections/), for awards and certificates for participating students
- Support for Abingdon's annual art show

### 💦 Field Day

Abingdon's physical education teachers organize an excellent Field Day every spring, in which students participate in a number of fun outdoor activities. The PTA spent about $100 to support this event last year, and we've budgeted a similar amount for this year.

### 🚶 Let’s Go Club

The Let's Go Club is a walking club that focuses on health and exercise. The program is managed by Ms. Caty Branco, Abingdon's bilingual parent liaison.

### 🏃‍♀️ Girls on the Run

Girls on the Run is a running program for girls in 3rd, 4th, and 5th grade.

## 🏫 Staff Grant Fund

The [Staff Grant Fund](/grants/) is new this year. Funds are intended to directly benefit as many students as possible. This allows us to identify new, worthwhile expenditures as the school year progresses.


## Community Relations

### 🥧 Adopt a Family

The PTA collaborates with the Student Services Team to feed needy Abingdon families during Thanksgiving and December. Most food is donated by the community.

### 🍲 Food Pantry

The PTA intends to operate a food pantry with donated funds this year.

### ☕ Coffee Events

The PTA intends to hold meet-and-greets with coffee to build community and to raise awareness of the PTA's activities and mission.

### 💦 Rising Kindergarten Playdates

The PTA organizes playdates for rising kindergarteners over the summer. 

### 🌈 Tears and Cheers

The PTA organizes a meet-and-greet for kindergarten parents on the first day of school.

### 🏘️ Neighborhood Playdates

The PTA holds playdates throughout Abingdon's attendance zone.

### 🍕 In-person PTA Meetings

The PTA holds most meetings virtually; however, we have set aside funds for an in-person meeting this year.

### 🌎 Spanish-language interpretation for meetings

The PTA pays for real-time Spanish-language translation of its General Membership meetings. Spanish is spoken at home by about 25% of Abingdon families.


## 🎉 Events

### 👋 Back to School Picnic

The PTA organizes a picnic in August to welcome families back to school.

### 🏠 Open House

The PTA sets up a table at Open House to establish connections with new and returning families.

### 🍂 Fall Event

We held a Trunk or Treat event last fall, and these funds will likely be used to hold a similar event this year.

### ❄️ Winter Event

We held a Winter Wonderland event last winter, and these funds will likely be used to hold a similar event this year.

### 🌱 Spring Event

The PTA organized an International Night event last spring, and these funds will likely be used to hold a similar event this year.

### 🎓 5th Grade Promotion

The PTA contributes to the 5th Grade Promotion Fund, which is used to celebrate 5th graders at their graduation.

### 🍿 Outdoor Movie Nights

The PTA would like to hold outdoor movie nights this year.

## 🙏 Staff Appreciation

The PTA treats Abingdon staff with meals, snacks, coffee, and other goodies at various times of the year as a way of saying thank you.

### 📎 Supply Buffet

The PTA occasionally organizes a "supply buffet" for staff, in which the PTA buys in-demand school supplies for staff to pick up.


## Administrative / Miscellaneous

### 🧻 Office Supplies

This expense is almost exclusively for paper that the PTA uses to send out flyers in Tuesday folders.

### 🧻 Laminator Film

The PTA has allocated funds to pay for film for the school's laminator, which the PTA provided as a gift to the school in the past. The PTA has allocated funds for laminator film for many years.

### 💲 Dues - Virginia PTA and Arlington CCPTA

For each payment of $5 membership dues, the Abingdon PTA must send $0.25 to the County Council of PTA's, $1.50 to the Virginia PTA, and $2.25 to the National PTA.

### 📰 E-mail Newsletter

The PTA uses Constant Contact to distribute its newsletter, the Cardinal Courier.

### ☎️ Student Directory

This is a new expense as we have not had a student directory in several years. The funds will go to a vendor who will make a student directory available online to the Abingdon community.

### ⛈️ Insurance

We are required by the state PTA to have an insurance policy. We spent about $180 on insurance last year, and we have budgeted a similar amount for this year.

### 💲 Transaction Fees

The PTA pays transaction fees for accepting credit cards.

### 🖥️ Website

Hosting our new website costs nothing, but our domain registration costs about $20 anually.
