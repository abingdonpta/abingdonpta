## 💵 Fundraising

### 🪙 Membership Dues

We had 180 members last year, each of whom paid $5 in membership dues, for a total of $900 in revenue. We expect a similar number of members this year.

### 💵 Donations

This is for open-ended donations made to the PTA.

### 🍂 Fall Fundraiser

These are the revenues from the Election Day Bake Sale.

### 📚 Read-a-Thon

### 📸 School Pictures

### 🛍️ Mixed bags

The "Mixed Bags" fundraiser is also known as the Boon Supply fundraiser - funds raised from a mail-order catalog program. We received about $1,500 from this fundraiser last year. NOTE: we did not hold this fundraiser in 2022-2023.

### 📖 Yearbooks & Lovelines

We received about $1,000 in yearbook sales in 2021-2022, while spending about $4,000 to have the yearbooks printed. We sold Lovelines this year (messages from families within the yearbook) to help offset the cost.

### 💸 Retail Rebates

Retail rebates are programs like Harris Teeter's "Together in Education" and AmazonSmile in which community members "link" their accounts with the PTA, which receives a portion of money spent at the vendor.

### ✏️ EduKit

Edukit offers prepackaged school supplies that are tailored to meet the needs of each grade at Abingdon Elementary. The PTA receives a portion of sales.

## 🎓 Educational Programs

### 🔔 After School Enrichment Scholarships

We provided after-school enrichment classes to students whose families would not otherwise be able to afford such classes.

### 🍅 Garden

We financially supported our school garden to ensure that it has sufficient supplies. These include tools, seeds, and potting soil.

### 🎭 School Play

Abingdon teacher Ms. Kerry Abbott puts on a wonderful school play every spring. Last year we purchased costumes for the play, which cost about $725. We have earmarked a similar amount for this year. NOTE: these funds were reprogrammed as the school play did not take place this year.

### 👨‍👦 Cardinal Kids Mentoring Program

The Cardinal Kids Mentoring Program matches students with staff members. The goals of the program are to build school connections, support academic success, increase self-esteem, and have fun. The funds expended last year were mostly spent on food and t-shirts for mentoring events. The program is managed by Ms. Caty Branco, Abingdon's bilingual parent liaison.

### 🌼 Hispanic Heritage Month

The PTA funds a breakfast each year that celebrates Hispanic Heritage Month.

### 📚 Book Fair

The PTA organized a book fair, which raised funds for the school library.

## 🙏 Staff Appreciation

The PTA treats Abingdon staff with meals, snacks, coffee, and other goodies at various times of the year as a way of saying thank you.

### 📎 Supply Buffet

This expense is almost exclusively for paper that the PTA uses to send out flyers in Tuesday folders.
