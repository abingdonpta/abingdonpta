It's time to register for the Winter Session of after-school enrichment classes! The Abingdon PTA is partnering with Baroody Camps to offer this program.

Classes will meet **January 17 â€“ March 17**. Families may view the list of classes and register for them here: https://bc-arl-abingdon.jumbula.com/#/winter-2023

Registration will open on **Monday, December 12 at 8 AM**. We are returning to our usual first-come-first-served registration method.

We have distributed paper forms to classroom teachers to place in backpacks next week. Paper registration forms are also available at Abingdon's front office. Paper forms can be turned in to the school's front office, emailed to info@baroodycamps.com or texted to 703-539-2602. Paper forms must be returned by January 6.
