## President's Message

Dear Abingdon Friends and Families,

It has been a joy and delight to see how much our school community enjoys the many PTA programs, activities, events, and partnerships that our organization has helped sponsor or facilitated this school year. In retrospect, so many terrific volunteers have helped with the classroom snack pantry, a staff grants program, funding field trips for all grade levels, facilitating afterschool enrichment and new programs such as the Cardinal Coding Club, tending to our revitalized school garden, bringing back the Reflections art program, and showing appreciation to the phenomenal Abingdon staff.

To that end, I am also excited for the several forthcoming initiatives that are underway. We have two fellow scouts who are pursuing service projects at Abingdon. Paul is stenciling a USA map on our black top and Faris will be updating our school hallways with multilingual signs. Additionally, I am pleased to share that former Abingdon alumnae Olivia and her HB Woodlawn colleagues will be visiting Abingdon to complete their service project this week. Lastly, I am also happy to share that local nonprofit Field to Table recently requested that the Abingdon PTA apply for a grant, which we recently submitted. 

Additionally, you are invited to [help support](https://www.signupgenius.com/go/30e0a44aca72aa5fe3-abingdon3#/) the fifth grade team with celebrating the achievements of our fifth graders, including their upcoming promotion ceremony. Also, please [consider signing up](https://www.signupgenius.com/go/30e0a44aca72aa5fe3-field1#/) to support Abingdon‚Äôs field day too.

As we continue to help our Cardinals soar together, I am delighted to recognize my colleague and  incoming president James for his leadership. As we also transition over to the new PTA volunteer board, please stay engaged and connected:  [**Facebook**](https://www.facebook.com/AbingdonElementaryPTA), [**Twitter**](https://twitter.com/AbingdonPTA), [**www.abingdonpta.org**](https://www.abingdonpta.org/), and [**WhatsApp groups**](https://www.abingdonpta.org/whatsapp/). Reach out to me at abingdonptapresident@gmail.com with any questions or comments. 

It has truly been a pleasure to serve our Abingdon community and we always remain thankful for your support as we elevate our Cardinal flock. Together, you have helped make a monumental difference with the Abingdon PTA by strengthening our home-school connection. Thank you and have a lovely summer.

Gratefully,  
Sharon Burd
