### Interested in Odyssey of the Mind? Let us Know!

Odyssey of the Mind is an international educational program that provides creative problem-solving opportunities for students from kindergarten through college. Team members apply their creativity and work together to solve a problem with their team of 5-7 students by meeting weekly to work together. Teams bring their solutions to compete at the regional meet at Wakefield High School on Saturday, March 9, 2024. Teams will meet from October through the date of the regional meet in March to work on the solution for the problem they selected. Teams may meet after school at Abingdon or at the coach's house, or a community center on the weekend if the team prefers. We do not have coaches in place yet. Please consider coaching! All coaches must go through the APS volunteer process.

### Reflections Art Contest

Our PTA is participating in Reflections - a national PTA-sponsored program that encourages students to express themselves artistically. We're calling all Abingdon students to create visual art or literature reflecting this year's theme: "I am Hopeful Because..." Students can create theme-based artwork in the categories of literature (written works) and visual arts (paintings, sculptures, drawings, and prints). All artworks will be recognized, celebrated, and judged by Abingdon volunteers by grade-level divisions. A selection of entries will advance to the county-wide competition. We are excited to see your talent! [More information is here](/reflections), and [in Spanish here](/es/reflections).

### After-School Enrichment Classes Start 10/10

After-school enrichment classes, managed by Baroody Camps, will kick off Wednesday, 10/10. Individual instructors will provide class details via email. Enjoy! 

### Abingdon Student Directory

In December 2022, the Abingdon PTA launched a new [online student directory](https://abingdonpta.membershiptoolkit.com/) for our school. The directory contains contact information for students' families to help those in the Abingdon community connect to arrange playdates, discuss classroom activities, share other school-related information, and more.

For returning Abingdon families, the directory remains available; please [log in](https://abingdonpta.membershiptoolkit.com/) to verify/update your contact information. You may also wish to update teacher assignments for your child(ren) or add a new student record if applicable. If you never set up your account last year, you can do so now by [following these instructions](/2022/12/01/directory/).

For new Abingdon families, the Abingdon PTA will update the directory this year based on the information families submit in the [Online Back-to-School Packet](https://www.apsva.us/registration/online-back-to-school-packet/). The directory will contain information and be accessible for only those families who opt in to share such information with the PTA as part of this annual online verification process. The deadline to complete the online packet is October 31, 2023, and the PTA will update the directory as soon as possible after that date.

### PTA Membership Signups
