## President's Message

Dear Abingdon Friends and Families,

As an organization, our goal is to build community and enrich the lives - especially the emotional well being - of our students through our volunteer work and ‚Ä¶. I hope we all can continuously support and uplift our community in challenging times and celebrations. That said, we remain appreciative of the care and kindness that our volunteers, Abingdon staff, donors, and benefactors tirelessly provide to help our children succeed in school.

With over a dozen languages spoken by families at Abingdon, we support engaging friends and neighbors within our culturally//beautifully diverse school community. I am thankful for the opportunity to participate in APS‚Äôs Family and Community Engagement (FACE) working group to update this Policy and Implementation Plan (PIP) and advocate for multilingual communication to ensure that all families can become effective partners to support their students.

You may be interested to know that the Abingdon PTA is partnering with one of our neighborhood civic associations - the Fairlington Citizens Association - to sponsor a MLK Day of Service Garden Workday at the Abingdon Community Garden. A guest reader will provide a storytime to kids in attendance to honor Dr. King‚Äôs leadership with the civil rights movement and the importance of building community through volunteer service. 

There are multiple ways to stay engaged and connected with us as we continue advocating for our Cardinals: [**Facebook**](https://www.facebook.com/AbingdonElementaryPTA), [**Twitter**](https://twitter.com/AbingdonPTA), [**www.abingdonpta.org**](https://www.abingdonpta.org/), and [**WhatsApp groups**](https://www.abingdonpta.org/whatsapp/). Reach out at **abingdonelementarypta@gmail.com** if you have any questions or comments to share with us. Thank you for your commitment to elevating our Cardinal flock‚Äôs elementary experience.

Wishing you a new year.

Gratefully,  
Sharon Burd
