## President's Message

Dear Abingdon Friends and Families,

Cheers to a new year! Building community and enriching the lives ‚Äî especially the emotional well being ‚Äî of our students through our volunteer work is instrumental. We‚Äôre excited for our PTA achievements and continue to support our community in challenging times and celebratory milestones. That said, we remain appreciative of the care and kindness that our volunteers, Abingdon staff, donors, and benefactors tirelessly provide to help our children succeed in school.

With over a dozen languages spoken by families at Abingdon, we support engaging friends and neighbors within our culturally and beautifully diverse school community. I am thankful for the opportunity to participate in APS‚Äôs Family and Community Engagement (FACE) working group to update their Policy and Implementation Plan (PIP) and advocate for multilingual communication to ensure that all families can become effective partners to support their students. I am also appreciative of our district PTA ‚Äî Arlington County Council of PTAs (CCPTA) ‚Äî to help Abingdon with our collective advocacy efforts.

You may be interested to know that the Abingdon PTA is partnering with one of our neighborhood civic associations ‚Äî the Fairlington Citizens Association ‚Äî to sponsor a MLK Day of Service Garden Workday at the Abingdon Community Garden. A guest reader will provide a storytime to kids in attendance to honor Dr. King‚Äôs leadership with the civil rights movement and the importance of building community through volunteer service. 

There are multiple ways to stay engaged and connected with us as we continue advocating for our Cardinals: [**Facebook**](https://www.facebook.com/AbingdonElementaryPTA), [**Twitter**](https://twitter.com/AbingdonPTA), [**www.abingdonpta.org**](https://www.abingdonpta.org/), and [**WhatsApp groups**](/whatsapp/). Reach out at **abingdonelementarypta@gmail.com** if you have any questions or comments to share with us. Thank you for supporting and inspiring our Abingdon flock.

Gratefully,  
Sharon Burd
