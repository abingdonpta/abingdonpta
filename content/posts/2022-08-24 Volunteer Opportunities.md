We are sharing two volunteer opportunities this week. If you're able to help out, please fill out the Signup Genius and email the volunteer lead(s) listed below. As you may know, APS requires that all parents volunteering in the building complete a Volunteer Application Form; [more information is available here](https://abingdon.apsva.us/families/volunteer). 

## EduKit Volunteers

Our fellow EduKit parent volunteer coordinator Samantha is looking for around 6+ adult volunteers to assist with packaging school supplies and delivering them to teachers' classrooms on **Friday, August 26 at 10 am** (for approximately 2 or 3 hours). The job will entail the following: sort, label and distribute about 125 boxes, plus smaller boxes of earbuds.

**Please note**: This is a physically demanding job, so it's best for people who are able to lift, carry, push dollies, etc. Volunteers should not bring children or babies; we will ultimately be working hard with the boxes in the gym and then disbursing across the building to deliver kits to classrooms.

If you are interested, [sign up here](https://www.signupgenius.com/go/30E0A44ACA72AA5FE3-edukit) and [email Samantha here](mailto:slevinefinley@gmail.com).

## Literacy Volunteers

Ms. Holly will be coordinating volunteers to help label phonic supplies. The literacy team needs 5-10 volunteers to assist with labeling phonic supplies. 

She can do an initial meeting with volunteers at one of the following times below to detail the process (approx. 10 minutes). Once she shows volunteers how to label a kit, there is flexibility during school hours when volunteers choose to come in to label. 

- Wednesday, **August 24** at 9:30-10:30 am
- Wednesday, **August 24** at 1:00-2:00 pm
- Thursday, **August 25** at 9:30-10:30 am

If you are interested, [sign up here](https://www.signupgenius.com/go/30E0A44ACA72AA5FE3-literacy) and [email Ms. Holly here](mailto:naomi.holly@apsva.us).
