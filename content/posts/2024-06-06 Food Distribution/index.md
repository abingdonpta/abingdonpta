Abingdon Elementary staff and the Abingdon PTA are seeking volunteers for upcoming distributions of fresh produce at the Park Shirlington apartments on the first Wednesday of each month at 12-3 pm this summer and fall. The school staff will not be able to be present for the July and August distributions, so some returning volunteers would be helpful on those two dates. Please sign up for the summer and fall dates by clicking below.
