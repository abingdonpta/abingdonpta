Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, deriving from Japanese Jiu-Jitsu, meaning "gentle art" and Judo, migrated to South America in the early 1900s where it transformed into a new martial art form by Brazilian pioneers. The belief is that Jiu-Jitsu travels back at least 4,000 years ago to Monks in India. After spreading to feudal Japan as hand-to-hand combat, in 1915 it arrived in Brazil. BJJ is widely regarded as a dynamic & effective martial arts for self defense. High Noon continues to share the love of the art form as a means for self defense and grappling.
