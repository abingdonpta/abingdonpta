## President’s Welcome

Dear Abingdon Friends and Families,

I am excited to welcome you to the 2022-2023 school year and I am humbled to lead our PTA. As Abingdon Cardinals prepare to soar off to a new school year, your new Abingdon PTA board is excited to see you at the school events, activities, and programs that we are planning for your students. Many of our events rely heavily on volunteers – we are always grateful for our families, staff, and organizations who help build and strengthen our school community. As I have learned from shoveling wood chips at one of our school garden workdays, many hands make light work. Kindly join our PTA volunteer team by filling out [our new volunteer form](https://www.abingdonpta.org/volunteer/).

Together, our partnership creates truly memorable experiences for our children. Please stay informed by visiting our newly-launched multilingual website [https://www.abingdonpta.org](https://www.abingdonpta.org), following us on social media on [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/AbingdonElementaryPTA) and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/abingdonpta), and reaching out to [abingdonelementarypta@gmail.com](mailto:abingdonelementarypta@gmail.com) with any questions or comments.

I hope to see you at the Back-to-School picnic. Wishing you a terrific school year!

Gratefully,

Sharon Burd  
PTA President

## Harris Teeter Rebates

Abingdon PTA participates in Harris Teeter’s Together in Education Program. Help raise money for Abingdon by linking your VIC Card Abingdon Elementary (**5748**). Please encourage friends, families, and neighbors to also link their VIC Card as well. When shopping for Harris Teeter products with your VIC Card, a percentage of your purchase will be donated to Abingdon Elementary through our PTA. Abingdon supporters are required to re-link their VIC Card every year. If you’d like to link your VIC Card, [click here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeiAe72qt4qTb_b2xmB-TUZByVkD-QxfVNyFEEHGc6sGkFzYQ/viewform).

## Labeling Students' Personal Items

Please label all of your student’s belongings (e.g., backpack, lunchbox, water bottle, and winter jacket) with their name. Labeling items can expedite the process of returning a lost item to its owner.
