Yes, the school year just ended. But no, it’s not too early to cross school supplies off your August to-do list. With a few taps now, you can kick back for the rest of the summer and benefit your child’s school at the same time.

This year, Abingdon PTA has partnered with a local, woman-owned school supply vendor: Campus Survival Kits. With Campus Survival Kits:

- Parents get lower prices;
- Teachers get the exact supplies they want in the way they want (personal vs. community);
- Abingdon gets free supply refills in January; and
- PTA gets more funding.

It’s a quadruple win! When does that ever happen?!?!
