## Summary

The IRS revoked Abingdon Elementary PTA's tax exemption on November 15, 2010. Despite efforts by previous PTA officers, the tax exemption has not been reinstated. However, we believe we are close to having the issue resolved, and we hope to have good news to share on that front in autumn or winter 2022-2023.

## Background

Every PTA is required to file a Form 990 with the IRS annually. The IRS uses the Form 990 to gather information about tax exempt organizations, including PTA's. However, Abingdon PTA did not file Form 990's in 2008, 2009, and possibly 2010 (or they were lost in the mail, or IRS misplaced them). As a result, the IRS revoked the PTA's tax exempt status, which they are required to do by [Internal Revenue Code section 6033(j)](https://uscode.house.gov/view.xhtml?req=granuleid:USC-prelim-title26-section6033&num=0&edition=prelim).

## Effect

This meant that any revenue brought in by the PTA after the revocation was (and is) potentially subject to taxation. It also meant that contributions by businesses and individuals to the PTA were not tax-deductible.

However, PTA leadership at the time either did not know that the tax exemption was revoked or did not inform others about what had happened. As a result, PTA operations continued normally until 2017 when the PTA received another letter from the IRS informing them that their tax exempt status had been revoked.

It is possible that the IRS revoked the PTA's tax exemption in 2017, but did so retroactively to 2010. The IRS was accepting the PTA's Form 990's [as recently as 2015](https://projects.propublica.org/nonprofits/display_990/521289072/2016_06_EO%2F52-1289072_990EZ_201506), which indicates that they believed the PTA was tax exempt at that time. This was likely IRS's error.

## Attempted resolution

Attempts to resolve the issue between 2017 and 2021 were not successful. On January 22, 2022, the PTA filed a Form 1023 with the IRS, which is an application for (re)-recognition of a tax exemption. Unfortunately, the IRS [has a backlog of about eight months](https://www.irs.gov/charities-non-profits/charitable-organizations/wheres-my-application-for-tax-exempt-status) for reviewing this type of form. As a result, the IRS will likely not begin to review our application until late September 2022 at the earliest.

## What this means for us

The good news is that if our application is approved, our tax exempt status will be reinstated retroactive to the date of our application - January 22, 2022. We believe our application will be approved, and that fundraising conducted from this point forward will not be subject to taxation.

However, we are reluctant to solicit funds from businesses until our tax exemption is formally approved by the IRS. Businesses expect that their contributions to PTA's will be tax-deductible; their bottom line may depend on it. They also often file taxes on a quarterly basis, meaning that they are likely to file taxes before our tax exemption is approved, which means that their tax deduction might be denied by the IRS. This would be a blow to any local business, and would do long-term reputational harm to our PTA.

Additionally, some businesses will explicitly require that the PTA have a tax exemption before working with us on fundraising. [Our lack of tax exemption is in the public record](https://apps.irs.gov/app/eos/detailsPage?ein=521289072&name=VIRGINIA%20CONGRESS%20OF%20PARENTS%20AND&city=ARLINGTON&state=VA&countryAbbr=US&dba=TEACHERSABINGDON&type=REVOCATION&orgTags=REVOCATION). Anyone can see it.

You may ask how the PTA held Spirit Nights and passive fundraising since 2010 without a tax exemption. We don't know. But we're unwilling to put our local businesses at risk by including them in our fundraising efforts while we don't have a tax exemption.

We look forward to resuming full fundraising activities as soon as our tax exemption is formally approved by the IRS. We will keep our membership updated on the status of our application.
