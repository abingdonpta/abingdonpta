### 🌎 International Night

Abingdon’s Annual International & Cultural Heritage and History Night is COMING! Last year’s event was a huge success thanks to the whole community who brought food and traditions to share, mingled, sang, danced, and volunteered throughout the beautiful night.

**This year**, we look forward to bringing our community together to celebrate the many various cultures that represent our student and staff population on **April 28th from 5:30 PM-7:30 PM**. We are excited to once again “break bread” together and learn traditions from one another. Please use the following [link](http://shorturl.at/wPTX7) to RSVP and let us know if you will be attending. We encourage families to consider sharing a dish from your culture, dress in traditional cultural attire, and invite you to share a cultural performance or tradition with the community. 

This event is a success **only** with your participation. Beyond joining in the fun, we also need **volunteers** to set up, work the event, and clean up at the end of the night. Please consider offering your time!

## 👉 Reminders

- 📚 **Read-A-Thon** is underway! Our students are on their journey around the world! They are taking planes, trains, automobiles to new destinations. As of Monday morning, our students have read 120,419 minutes and thanks to our partnership with you, our PTA has raised over $16,000! Help us meet our goal to raise $20,000 in our biggest fundraiser of the school year! 
    - If your student has not signed up, it is NOT too late. Join the Read-A-Thon by joining @ **https://www.read-a-thon.com/readers/r/AwAipj**. You will have the ability to share with family and friends who might donate to our PTA while you and your student track daily reading minutes. Remember, reading is reading! Track minutes for reading silently, aloud, solo, to a friend, a sibling, a stuffed animal, or a pet. Track minutes listening to a story aloud from a parent, a sibling, an audio recording! We appreciate your support of literacy and our fundraiser.
