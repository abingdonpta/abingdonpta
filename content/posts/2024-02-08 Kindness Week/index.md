Please join us in celebrating all things **KIND** next week for **Virginia Kindness Week 2024**! There will be many ways to join in on the fun:

- **Monday, Feb. 12** — "Kindness Shines" wear neon/glittery
- **Tuesday, Feb. 13** — "Kindness Week Kick-Off" silly sock day
- **Wednesday, Feb. 14** — "I ❤️ Kindness" wear red/pink/hearts
- **Thursday, Feb. 15** — "Kindness TIES Us Together" wear a tie/bow or tie-dye
- **Friday, Feb. 16** — "We Dream of Kindness" pajama day

The purpose of Kindness Week is to recognize simple day-to-day acts of kindness that enable our schools, communities, and state to be a kinder, safer, healthier, and more inclusive place to live, work, learn and play.

Teaching and recognizing kindness in schools and communities fosters empathy, builds community, reduces bullying and nurtures a safe and welcoming environment.

Teachers will be tracking the number of students who participate in Spirit Week! The three classes with the most points will earn a prize!
