The Abingdon PTA has launched a fabulous new website that's **helpful**, **fast**, and **cheap**.

- **Helpful**: The site's content is completely up-to-date, with information about PTA roles, important documents, and highlights of PTA programs.
- **Fast**: The site is very fast. Pages load almost instantly and use minimal resources. The new site won't spin up your laptop fan or burn though your mobile data cap.
- **Cheap**: The site costs nothing to host. This is a considerable savings from our previous website host. We also changed domain registrars; together, the two changes result in savings of $500 per year.

If you have suggestions for the new website, let us know at abingdonelementaryPTA@gmail.com.

For those interested in technical details, the new website runs on [Hugo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hugo_(software)), a static site generator. It's hosted for free on Github and Cloudflare. If you're interested in serving as a backup administrator for this website, please reach out to abingdonelementaryPTA@gmail.com. We'd be happy to show you the ropes.
