The Abingdon PTA is proud to announce the Reflections Arts Program for 2022!

{{< flyer src="social/r---show-your-voice_facebook.webp" alt="Reflections Call for Entries flyer" >}}

Reflections is a national PTA-sponsored program that encourages students to express themselves artistically. Each year the National PTA selects a theme and students create and submit a work of art that reflects the theme. The work is then judged by volunteers here at Abingdon, and then at the county level if they advance.

This year's theme is **Show Your Voice**. Abingdon students are invited to create works of visual art that reflects this theme.

While the Abingdon PTA learns how to organize the Reflections program, we are limiting this year's submissions to **visual arts** - paintings, sculptures, and similar works. Next year we may accept other types of submissions.
