Abingdon PTA has decided to hold a Read-a-thon this year!

Read-a-thons actually get your reader excited about reading and give friends and family the opportunity to encourage your child to read even more.

Our Read-a-thon starts Monday March 11, 2024.

About one week before our Read-a-thon starts we will send home instructions on how to activate your reader's personal page. This is where you will be able to view and record their progress.

We encourage you to activate your readerâ€™s account today by clicking on https://www.read-a-thon.com/readers/r/323337383936/1 and following the simple instructions.

We've chosen Read-a-thon because it will not take much of your time, gives your child a reason to read and helps in the development of stronger reading skills.

We hope EVERYONE participates!
