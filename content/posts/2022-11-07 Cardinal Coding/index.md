The PTA is launching our first Cardinal Coding Club this month! Students in 3rd - 5th grade are invited to join us after school on Wednesdays starting in November. We are collaborating with Boolean Girl, a local non-profit, whose mission is to engage students in computer science. Registration will open on Thursday, November 10, 2022 at 12 pm; the registration link will be shared on the PTA’s Facebook and Twitter at noon. If you have any questions, reach out to Teresa Valdez-Bain at ftvedu@yahoo.com.

*Cardinal Coding Club: Mixing hands-on coding with interactive play, your young Computer Scientist will learn basic coding principles that allow them to bring stories to life. Using Scratch, a drag-and-drop multimedia programming language designed by MIT, children learn algorithms and programming all while developing and illustrating their own personal stories. Ms. Molly Fisher, Abingdon’s Instructional Technology Coordinator (ITC), will model how to plan, develop, and create a story using Scratch. Even Pixar will be impressed with the final creations!*
