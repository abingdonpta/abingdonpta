## President's Message

Dear Abingdon Friends and Families,

I am so very grateful for the many community members who have stepped up to serve on the PTA board next school year; however, please note that the Communications VP position is still vacant. This position requires a candidate who can provide quality and accurate communication in an effective and timely manner to inform our community about PTA activities and school events. Please reach out to me at abingdonptapresident@gmail.com if you're interested.

If you have any comments to share with our School Board, you can email them at school.board@apsva.us, or our superintendent at superintendent@apsva.us, and/or reach out to individual school board members as well. I have heard from many fifth graders, families, and educators who have expressed concerns about the cancellation of the overnight component of the Outdoor Lab field trip for 5th grade students. I'm sharing a letter below that I recently sent to our superintendent and School Board in response to this decision: 

> Dear Dr. Durán and School Board Members:
>
> I urge you to reconsider the “pause” on overnight trips to the Outdoor Lab and instead immediately resume overnight field trips for our Abingdon fifth graders.
>
> This “pause” impacts Abingdon's fifth grade kids who were scheduled to visit the Outdoor Lab during the first week of May. I have heard from many fifth grade Cardinals and educators who have expressed their disappointment and devastation about the overnight visit cancellation. Parents were informed that the scheduled overnight trip would be a series of day trips.
>
> The Outdoor Lab has been providing exceptional and enriching experiences to Arlington students for decades. Many Arlingtonians — including one of Abingdon’s fifth grade teachers — have fond memories of their overnight experiences at the Outdoor Lab.
>
> As you know, this memorable experience is a rite of passage for our fifth graders in Arlington. The camaraderie and bonding amongst our 106 fifth grade students from this shared experience is immeasurable.
>
> Additionally, these fifth grade students have also missed out on other indelible childhood experiences (e.g., Jamestown field trip) due to COVID-related pandemic cancellations. It is upsetting for our students to miss so many school milestones and fun, monumental experiences. This camping trip was heralded as a long-promised return to normalcy that our children so desperately need and deserve.
>
> A Native American proverb is painted in the Outdoor Lab dining hall: “We don't inherit the Earth from our ancestors, we borrow it from our children.” Please allow our school children to be a part of this longstanding tradition. Please reinstate overnight field trips at the Outdoor Lab for our fifth graders.
>
> Thank you kindly for considering this request to support our 106 fifth grade Cardinals.
>
> Gratefully,  
> Sharon Burd  
> Abingdon PTA President
