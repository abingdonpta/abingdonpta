All Abingdon families are invited to a celebration of the many cultures and heritages of our Abingdon community. We invite you to come explore, dance, eat, and have fun! You are encouraged to attend wearing clothes representing your culture/heritage.

We are looking for your help. Would you like to:
- create an amazing visual, interactive display or craft project?
- teach a dance lesson or perform a cultural dance?
- participate in a fashion parade?
- bring an amazing international dish for our potluck feast? (Please place food dishes on food tables outside.)
- participate in something we haven't considered?

If so, please email meregreene5@gmail.com.
