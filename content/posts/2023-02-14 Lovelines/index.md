Yearbook Lovelines are back for the 2023 yearbook! You can leave a special message for your student or your student can leave a message for their friends!

Example:

> *Chloe, you have had such a full year with so many challenges and successes! We are so proud of you and we love you so much. Onward to the 6th grade you go! Love, Mom, Dad, Misha & Cookie*

**Cost**: $5 per entry, one entry per form.

(Additional donations are welcome - all funds will be going toward providing our 5th graders with a free yearbook.)

Please make checks out to "Abingdon Elementary PTA." Cash payment accepted too. **All requests are due March 15, 2023.**

If you have any questions, reach out to abingdonelementarypta@gmail.com.

Please detach the bottom part of the form below and submit with payment to your student's teacher. You should have received this form in your Tuesday folder that went home on February 14 â€” if not, you can print out the form below.
