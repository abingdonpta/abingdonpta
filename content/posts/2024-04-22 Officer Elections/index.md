Abingdon PTA's leadership consists of 9 elected positions: president, secretary, treasurer, and 6 vice presidents for particular areas. All positions are 1-year terms and not to exceed 2 consecutive terms for any officeholder. In other words, every spring, Abingdon PTA elects all 9 of its leaders for the next year. Any dues paying PTA member may seek election and serve as an officer.

Here's the timeline for this year's election:

- **Today**: Announcement of upcoming elections and re-election status of each incumbent
- **Late April - Early May**: Informal Q&A sessions for any member potentially interested in running for the board
- **Thursday, May 16**: Nominations from floor at our next scheduled general membership meeting
- **Thursday, June 6 or 13** (exact date TBD): Final general membership meeting of 2023-2024 to elect officers and vote on a summer budget

And here's a breakdown of every officer position and whether the incumbent is running for re-election:
