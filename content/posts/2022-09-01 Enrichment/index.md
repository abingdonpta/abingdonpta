It's time to register for the Fall Session of after-school enrichment classes! The Abingdon PTA is partnering with Baroody Camps to offer this program.

Classes will meet **September 19 â€“ November 17**. Families may view the list of classes and register for them here: https://bc-arl-abingdon.jumbula.com/#/fall-2022

Registration is currently open and continues until **Friday, September 9**. Due to timing constraints with notifying families about this session, **registration is not first-come, first-served**. As long as you register by September 9, your child will be considered for a spot. A lottery system will be used if there is more demand for a class than there is space available. We know this method is different from our typical process and we apologize for any confusion this may cause.

We have distributed paper forms to classroom teachers to place in backpacks next week. Paper registration forms are also available at Abingdon's front office. Paper forms can be turned in to the school's front office, emailed to info@baroodycamps.com or texted to 703-539-2602. Paper forms must be returned by September 9, so that there is time to conduct the lottery, notify everyone, and finalize the registrations. Online registration is preferred to paper forms.

Questions? Contact us at abingdonelementarypta@gmail.com. Thank you kindly.
