On November 9, Abingdon students participated in the Reflections program for the first time in a decade. Their exceptional artwork was exhibited in the school cafeteria for everyone to enjoy. Each student was recognized for their talent and creativity.

Three students will go on to represent Abingdon at the [Arlington County Reflections contest](https://www.apsva.us/post/arlington-county-council-of-ptas-announced-the-2022-23-reflections-winners/), which will be held at Washington-Liberty High School on January 17.
