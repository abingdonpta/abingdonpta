In December 2022, the Abingdon PTA launched a new [online student directory](https://abingdonpta.membershiptoolkit.com/) for our school. The directory contains contact information for students’ families to help those in the Abingdon community connect to arrange playdates, discuss classroom activities, share other school-related information, and more.

*For returning Abingdon families*, the directory remains available; please [log in](https://abingdonpta.membershiptoolkit.com/) to verify/update your contact information. You may also wish to update teacher assignments for your child(ren) or add a new student record if applicable. If you never set up your account last year, you can do so now by [following these instructions](/2022/12/01/directory/).

*For new Abingdon families*, the Abingdon PTA will update the directory this year based on the information families submit in the [Online Back-to-School Packet](https://www.apsva.us/registration/online-back-to-school-packet/). The directory will contain information and be accessible for only those families who opt in to share such information with the PTA as part of this annual online verification process. The deadline to complete the online packet is October 31, 2023, and the PTA will update the directory as soon as possible after that date.
