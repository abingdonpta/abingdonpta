There are several volunteer opportunities available with both the PTA and with Abingdon.

If you're worried about overcommitting, don't be! PTA volunteer opportunities are structured to fit within the busy lives of our members. And the Board is committed to a no-drama, enjoyable experience for volunteers.

## Trunk or Treat

Abingdon's 3rd Annual Trunk or Treat is on Saturday, October 28, from 1-3. Volunteer to decorate your trunk and pass out candy, supervise pumpkin decorating, or help with setup or cleanup. Sign up [HERE](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScaHcqXP6ak0Q-Jr50qd-ilBG4Gt7EpA5Wu9yqiIo44yMZMNQ/viewform).

*Ad Hoc Volunteers*. PTA generates plenty of odd jobs—from printing flyers and stuffing teacher mailboxes, to staffing picture day and volunteering at events. We push out these one-off opportunities to members who opt-in to the ad hoc volunteer list. (We don't want to spam all members unnecessarily.)
- Contact James Harlow, [president@abingdonpta.org](mailto:president@abingdonpta.org), to be added to the volunteer listserv.
