We are excited to announce that the Abingdon Read-A-Thon is back! This fun event encourages students to read & build literacy skills while also raising money for our school.

**Here’s how it works:**

- Read-A-Thon will run from **March 13th - 24th** 
- Families will use Abingdon’s Read-A-Thon Link: https://www.read-a-thon.com/readers/r/AwAipj/1 to sign up their student and **create a reader page**.
- Students and families can share their reader page with loved ones to request support in the form of online **donations**. Family & friends often enjoy encouraging your student to reach their reading goals!
- Once the Read-A-Thon begins on March 13th, students will read and track their reading minutes on their reader page. 

**What reading counts?**  
- **All reading - both in & out of class - between March 13th and March 24th counts**. Teachers will log in-class reading for students. Students will log additional non-classroom reading for themselves on their reader page.
- Lexia minutes will be added to classroom totals at the end of each week - no need to add Lexia minutes on the student’s reader page.
- Being read to by a friend or family member also counts. 
- Reading aloud to someone else (younger sibling, pet, stuffed animal, etc.) counts. If the person being read to is also participating in the Read-A-Thon, it counts for you both!

**Rewards and Prizes!**  
- All readers must **set up their profile** to log minutes and to be entered to win prizes!
- Students who set up their profile pages will earn a Read-A-Thon bookmark!
- Students will earn rewards when reaching **250** minutes, **500** minutes, and **1000** minutes!
- All participating students will be entered into raffles throughout Read-A-Thon to win special prizes, announced during Morning Announcements!
- Top readers in each grade will earn a special reward, and classes with the highest totals in each grade will be celebrated for their accomplishments with an exciting reward!

**Important Dates:**  
- **UPDATE**: *The Book Swap is canceled. Teachers and the literacy team will be making sure that your students have plenty of books to choose from throughout the Read-a-thon.*
- **Monday, March 13th** - Read-A-Thon begins! Be sure your student’s reader page is active and ready to record reading minutes!
- **Friday, March 17th** - Read The Day Away is our celebration of reading at Abingdon. Look out for details about mystery readers in classrooms!
- **Friday, March 24th** - The Read-A-Thon reader pages will close at the end of the night! Log all reading minutes before midnight!

Abingdon PTA has decided to hold a Read-a-thon this year!

Read-a-thons actually get your reader excited about reading and it gives friends and family the opportunity to encourage your child to read even more.

Our Read-a-thon starts Monday March 13, 2023.

About one week before our Read-a-thon starts we will send home instructions on how to activate your reader's personal page. This is where you will be able to view and record their progress.

We encourage you to activate your reader’s account today by clicking on https://www.read-a-thon.com/readers/r/AwAipj/1 and following the simple instructions.

We've chosen Read-a-thon because it will not take much of your time, gives your child a reason to read and helps in the development of stronger reading skills.

We hope EVERYONE participates.

Thanks so much,  
Abingdon PTA
