## President's Message

Dear Abingdon Friends and Families,

At the first grade field trip to the Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History last week, it was remarkable to see the awe on students' faces as they explored the exhibits with much wonder and astonishment. For many students, it was their first visit to this museum. The trip concluded with a class picnic on the National Mall enjoying the views of the U.S. Capitol and Washington Monument on a beautifully warm spring day. This field trip illuminates one of the many collaborations on how the Abingdon PTA and our school partner together to support student success. Once again, a heartfelt thank you for the generous grant from our community donor which covered the transportation cost and the first grade teaching team for planning such a remarkable and memorable experience.

At a recent school board meeting, two of Abingdon's staffers — Ms. Davis and Ms. Palacios — were recognized for their APS career milestones of 30 and 35 years of APS service. It was a joyous celebration to applaud and cheer on Abingdon's educators. And speaking of supporting educators, please join the PTA in celebrating all of Abingdon's remarkable educators and staff during Teacher Appreciation Week. We are beyond grateful today — and every day — for our superhero Abingdon staff for inspiring generations of Cardinals and making monumental differences in their lives.

At International Night, a parent inquired about the purpose of the Abingdon PTA. We are the home-school connection, always finding ways to support our school and also ensuring that all students are given the best public education. So many PTA and school activities and events are done with much care and love from our volunteers. I hope you will join us at tomorrow's virtual general membership meeting to vote on our new PTA officers and review the proposed summer budget. 

Stay engaged and connected as we continue to help our Cardinals soar:  [**Facebook**](https://www.facebook.com/AbingdonElementaryPTA), [**Twitter**](https://twitter.com/AbingdonPTA), [**www.abingdonpta.org**](https://www.abingdonpta.org/), and [**WhatsApp groups**](https://www.abingdonpta.org/whatsapp/). As we wrap up the last weeks of school, please be on the lookout for volunteer opportunities to support our students. Reach out to me at [abingdonptapresident@gmail.com](mailto:abingdonptapresident@gmail.com) with any questions or comments. 

Gratefully,  
Sharon Burd
