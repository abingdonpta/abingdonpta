Odyssey of the Mind offers students the chance to hone their creative thinking skills and work on a team to solve a problem. If your child likes building, creative thinking, working with others, or solving problems - Odyssey might be a great activity! Parents - if you like watching students do these things - with minimal adult interference, then come and learn more and sign up to coach a team (training is available)! Teams will meet at least once weekly until a March tournament at Wakefield High School, where they present their work before an audience and judges.

ZOOM info will be provided if needed when you RSVP.

**We still need coaches; please sign up to coach a team.** The time commitment is only 1-2 hours a week, and you can work out when and where to meet with your team that best suits you and your team. If we have enough parents to co-coach, the time commitment will be less.
