Teacher Appreciation Week is right around the corner - May 6th-10th. The PTA is hoping to once again blow the Abingdon Staff away to show our sincerest appreciation for all they do to support our students, families, and school! 

Ashley Farrugia is seeking volunteers who can help. Please show your availability to support using the SignUp Genius. Should you have questions, please email ashleybethmccarthy@gmail.com.

Along with volunteers, we are once again planning to raffle off gift cards for the staff. Please drop donated gift cards (price and location of your choice) to the Main Office where there will be a collection envelope. 

With volunteers we can make this happen!

With our sincerest appreciation,  
\- The PTA Board
