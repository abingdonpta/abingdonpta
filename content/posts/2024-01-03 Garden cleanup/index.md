**UPDATE 1/15/2024: Yes, this is still happening with snow on the ground. It will just be more magical. ✨**

You are cordially invited to join us for a garden service opportunity to honor Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. on Monday, January 15 from 10 a.m. – 12 p.m.

The PTA is partnering with the Fairlington Citizens Association to sponsor a MLK Day of Service Garden Workday at the Abingdon Community Garden. Everybody is welcome to lend a helping hand to support our garden goals: removing invasive plants from school grounds, weeding the new pollinator garden, digging up a garden bed with invasive milkweed, and picking up trash from the school grounds.

We would love your support to maintain a successful, sustainable community garden. Prior gardening experience is not required. Bring your water bottle, as well as your garden gloves and shovel if you have one. Scope out our garden map here: [www.abingdonpta.org/garden](/garden). We hope you will join us.

- **When**: Monday, January 15, 2024 from 10:00 am – 12:00 pm
- **Where**: Abingdon Community Garden, next to the school.
