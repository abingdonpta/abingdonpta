After [yesterday's announcement of criminal charges against a former school staffer](https://www.arlingtonva.us/About-Arlington/Newsroom/Articles/2024/Extended-Day-Employee-Charged-Possible-Additional-Victims-Sought), we have coordinated with the Arlington Police Department's Special Victims Unit and the Arlington Department of Human Resources to arrange a briefing for parents from the Arlington Child Advocacy Center.

The [Child Advocacy Center](https://www.arlingtonva.us/Government/Departments/DHS/Child-Family-Services/Childrens-Advocacy-Center) is a county program that promotes the safety and well-being of children in Arlington County when there is an allegation of sexual, severe physical, or mental abuse. The Center offers a comfortable, child-friendly environment where children feel safe to describe their alleged abusive experience, as well as receive a mental health needs assessment and services to meet their particular needs.

**This Monday (April 29) at 6 PM in the Abingdon school library, Center Director Laura Ragins will conduct a briefing for Abingdon parents.** Ms. Ragins will be joined by members of the Center's multi-disciplinary team, which includes the Special Victims Unit, Child Protective Services and DHS Behavioral Health. The briefing will include guidance about how to talk with children about the allegations, as well as information about what to expect from the process.

For those unable to attend in-person, check our newsletter for a Zoom link.

We apologize for the short notice, but we wanted to get this setup as promptly as possible. Please note that this event is for parents only. And unfortunately, due to the timing, the PTA won't be able to provide child care.
