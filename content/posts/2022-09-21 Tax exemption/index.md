The IRS has reinstated the Abingdon PTA's federal tax exemption, several years after it was revoked. [(We described the revocation here.)](/2022/04/15/tax-exemption)

We can now accept donations with confidence that those donations will be tax-exempt for us and tax-deductible for the donor. This also means that we can fundraise from businesses, including Spirit Nights at local restaurants. (Spirit Night is a fundraiser where the restaurant partners with Abingdon PTA for an evening and a percentage of profits are donated back to our organization to support programs and activities for our students.)  We are very excited to start these up again soon.

Reinstating our tax exemption was the last task that the Abingdon PTA needed to accomplish before being considered to be in "good standing" with the county and state PTA's. As a result, our vote on the Arlington County Council of PTA's (CCPTA) was restored. At the September 19 CCPTA meeting, **Abingdon was proud to be one of only five PTA units in good standing — and able to vote — out of the approximately thirty-five units that the CCPTA oversees.**

The Abingdon PTA will continue to maintain our tax exemption by filing Form 990's with the IRS starting in July 2023, and every July thereafter. Additionally, we will continue to maintain our good standing with the county and state PTA's by [completing an audit every July](/documents/#audits), keeping our membership and officer lists up-to-date, renewing our insurance policy, and paying our dues to the county and state PTA's. If you would like to help in these efforts, [please fill out our volunteer form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSf50HFDkNfDxP5VfE2LzsxKbUPZdmRGQTeNEUhXkU_qLCLWZQ/viewform?usp=sf_link).
