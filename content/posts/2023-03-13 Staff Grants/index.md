The Abingdon PTA started a [Grant Program](/grants) this year in order to support student learning in the classroom and beyond by funding materials, projects, and experiences beyond the core basics provided by Arlington Public Schools.

Our second tranche of staff grants are being disbursed to staff. If you would like to apply for our spring grants, please do so by [following the instructions here](/grants) by March 21.

## English Language Learner materials

Ms. Helen Ryan, one of our English Learner teachers, requested phonics, reading, and word materials and games for English Language learner students and also to support emerging readers. They will be used for both English as a second language and 2nd grade readers.

## Mallets for Smaller Hands

Ms. Janet Kingsley, one of our music teachers, requested 30 sets of mallets for playing the xylophones and glockenspiels for children in grades K-2. These will also be used for small hand-held percussion.
