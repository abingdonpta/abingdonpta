## President's Message

Dear Abingdon Friends and Families,

I am pleased to share that Abingdon PTA‚Äôs tax exemption status has recently been reinstated after over a decade of being revoked. To celebrate this milestone, we will be hosting a community celebration next month: Spirit Night at Chipotle on Columbia Pike. These fundraising activities support our free community-building events (e.g., Trunk or Treat) and educational programs such as the Cardinal Kids Mentoring Program and our School Play. Furthermore, we are delighted to launch our [staff grants program](https://www.abingdonpta.org/grants/) to help meet needs for our educators that are not provided for by the school district such as funding for field trips. Living right next door to the nation‚Äôs capital affords us a wealth of learning opportunities for our Cardinals to learn and explore. 

While our volunteer team generously supports enriching our Cardinals‚Äô classroom experience, another priority is to collectively influence policymakers to best support our students. For example, you may have noticed that Abingdon‚Äôs oldest tree in the back playground was recently removed prior to the start of the school year due to heart rot; we have asked our school district to consider providing commercial sail shade coverage for our back (red) playground to make recess more enjoyable during the extremely hot and sunny days. We have also initiated conversations with fellow Arlingon PTAs through the Arlington County Council of PTAs (CCPTA) about how we can best support field trips.

In other news, we are also kindly reminding our school community and neighbors to keep their dogs off school grounds and to be mindful of our student pedestrians; safety is our highest priority. We have asked our county‚Äôs Transportation Engineering and Operations Bureau Chief to have an engineer evaluate our limited school signage, and how we can best promote additional signage to remind drivers to slow down in our school zone. We are also fighting food insecurity with the launch of our new snack pantry program, which is available to all students courtesy of a very generous donation. Furthermore, we have been partnering with local neighborhood businesses and organizations on ways we can collaborate together to support the Abingdon family. 

As we strengthen our family-school engagement at Abingdon, consider lending your time, skills, and voice. These meaningful conversations that we have at student pick up, or at our PTA meetings, help foster thoughtful considerations and build trust. Together we can be a powerful advocate for our flock. 

I hope you will consider staying engaged and connected with us as we continue advocating for our Cardinals: [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/AbingdonElementaryPTA), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/AbingdonPTA), [www.abingdonpta.org](https://www.abingdonpta.org/), [WhatsApp groups](https://www.abingdonpta.org/whatsapp/). Please reach out at abingdonelementarypta@gmail.com if you have any questions or comments to share with us. Thank you kindly.

Gratefully,  
Sharon Burd

P.S. We have nearly doubled our participants with Harris Teeter‚Äôs retail rebates program - 99 participants have linked their VIC card to Abingdon.
