## President's Message

Dear Abingdon Friends and Families,

On the last day of Thinking Outside the Box afterschool enrichment class, you may have seen the class's afterschool enrichment teacher launch the students' water bottle rockets in front of the school as many kids watched in awe at a distance. (A few bottle rockets may have landed on the school roof.) It was also a delight to see the excitement on students' faces as their parents popped by their final winter enrichment class to watch their ballerinas, actors/actresses, and baton twirlers demonstrate their talent. We are glad to offer this educational programming ‚Äî along with providing full scholarships ‚Äî and thank the many Abingdon educators who carve out additional time to teach classes and to the many educators who generously share their classrooms with us.

In other news, mark your calendar for Abingdon's International Night ‚Äî the biggest event of the year where we celebrate the beautiful cultural diversity of our school community. There are 5 major languages spoken by families at our school (English, Mongolian, Arabic, Spanish, and Amharic). As many know, we have over 20 languages spoken by Abingdon families. International Night is a terrific opportunity for students, families, and educators to showcase their cultural heritage, travel the world, and build community memories. I hope you will volunteer your time and participate in this event.

Together, you have helped make a monumental difference with the Abingdon PTA by strengthening our home-school connection. Our organization is volunteer-driven by our volunteers who help make a difference. I encourage you to [reach out to our nominating committee to submit an application for an officer role](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScPl5b8CzjnBYOVNXnR33plv3YKtS6cpMw67xFKSorHwZ7i5g/viewform?usp=share_link) for the 2023-2024 school year. In order for the Abingdon PTA to operate, we will need a president, treasurer, and secretary for the upcoming school year.

Stay engaged and connected as we continue advocating for our Cardinals:  [**Facebook**](https://www.facebook.com/AbingdonElementaryPTA), [**Twitter**](https://twitter.com/AbingdonPTA), [**www.abingdonpta.org**](https://www.abingdonpta.org/), and [**WhatsApp groups**](https://www.abingdonpta.org/whatsapp/). Please reach out to me at [abingdonptapresident@gmail.com](mailto:abingdonptapresident@gmail.com) with any questions or comments. Thank you for helping our Cardinals soar.

Ramadan Mubarak to our families.

Gratefully,  
Sharon Burd

{{< imagehalftoc class="halfright" src="images/earth-day-flyer.png" alt="Earth Day flyer" >}}

This spring our school garden will approach its 32nd anniversary.  We will be hosting an Abingdon Earth Day Celebration to honor this historic milestone and a ribbon cutting ceremony to unveil our new school garden shed built by Yorktown High School student and Troop 106 Scout Thomas Totten.  We will also be cleaning up the garden and picking up litter from school grounds.

### üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Girls on the Run

The Abingdon Girls on the Run Team is off to a great start as we kicked off our re-entry season at Abingdon! Our students and coaches are enjoying setting star goals, getting to know one another, learning how to be strong and independent, and practicing our running. We have been confirmed for our 5K! 

- WHEN: Sunday, May 21st at 8:30am
- WHERE: BASIS Independent School, [8000 Jones Branch Drive, McLean VA, 22012](https://www.google.com/maps/search/?api=1&query=Basis+Independent+McLean+8000+Jones+Branch+Dr+22102&destination_place_id=ChIJPzARhZZKtokRwLV5jHcohiE)

Each GOTR student will need a 'buddy runner,' which is an adult to run the course with them. Please consider joining as a buddy runner. Many family members or friends will join their specific GOTR students, but some girls will not have an adult that they can run with. We encourage our Abingdon community to register to run and support. If you are interested, please reach out to Ashley Farrugia ([ashleybethmccarthy@gmail.com](mailto:ashleybethmccarthy@gmail.com)) or Erin Mahaffey ([eemahaffey@gmail.com](mailto:eemahaffey@gmail.com)).

Abingdon Girls on the Run participants do NOT need to register. 

Non-running volunteers are also needed on 5K day. GOTR NOVA will need people to help with packet pickup, race-day water stations, cheering, corralling, and several other race-related activities. If you are able to help, registration will be available in May; we will share the link as it comes available. 

Anyone can register, so share widely and let us know if you have any questions. Thank you!

Further information from Girls on the Run:

> **Why do we have Buddy Runners?**
>
> At Girls on the Run of Northern Virginia, we want all of our Girls on the Run and Heart & Sole participants to have a positive 5K experience at the end of their 10-week programs. By the time they get to the 5K, the girls have hopefully developed the skills they need to be confident, happy, and healthy as they navigate future life challenges.
>
> For many of them, the Girls on the Run 5K event is their first 5K. We expect large crowds with more than 2,000 runners at each event day. Buddy Runners provide support and encouragement as the girls participate in the 5K events.
>
> **What is the role of a Buddy Runner?**
>
> Buddy Runners are able to focus on one specific participant and their personal goals, ensuring they have a positive experience of healthy goal setting and achievement - a lesson we hope will stay with them long after they cross this finish line.
