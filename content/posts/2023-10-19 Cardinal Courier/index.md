## The Details

### Feeling the Abingdon Love This Week!

Thank you to everyone - including a few Abingdon staff VIPs! - who joined Silver Diner Spirit Night! We had a packed house and raised hundreds of dollars for Abingdon. What an amazing community!

Thank you also for your generous donations to sponsoring lunch for teachers today, parent-teacher conference day. With your superior support, we raised over $500! Abingdon staff will be well-fed, cheerful, and filled up on appreciation thanks to you!

### Odyssey of the Mind Info Session, 10/25 @ 6:30

[Odyssey of the Mind](https://www.odysseyofthemind.com/) offers students the chance to hone their creative thinking skills and work on a team to solve a problem. If your child likes building, creative thinking, working with others, or solving problems - Odyssey might be a great activity! Parents - if you like watching students do these things - with minimal adult interference, then come and learn more and sign up to coach a team (training is available)! Teams will meet at least once weekly until a March tournament at Wakefield High School, where they present their work before an audience and judges.

Join us for an info session on Wednesday, October 25, 2023, at 6:30pm in the Abingdon Library.

- RSVP for the meeting here: https://forms.gle/m3fBcXGo4qCpyDiK6 (ZOOM info will be provided if needed when you RSVP) 
- Sign up here to join a team: https://forms.gle/fWpygwSpenZfD1FR9
- We still need coaches; please sign up to coach a team. The time commitment is only 1-2 hours a week, and you can work out when and where to meet with your team that best suits you and your team. If we have enough parents to co-coach, the time commitment will be less.
