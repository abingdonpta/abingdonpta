## President's Message

Dear Abingdon Friends and Families,

As we celebrate our school community‚Äôs accomplishments, I am thankful to the many hardworking volunteers, educators, staff, and families/friends who have been generous with their time, energy, and kindness to support our Cardinals. Every task or activity (e.g., writing our school board to advocate for Abingdon‚Äôs Extended Day staff, creating a bulletin board, or translating a flyer) has a lot of love and care put into it. Through our organization, we find ways to support the classroom, our educators, and most importantly, our children.

Among the many community-building activities we have recently hosted or sponsored, we loved seeing our Cardinals dressed in their costumes and Trunk or Treating in the school parking lot. The cheers and giggles from students enjoying the beautiful autumn day with their friends and families will surely be an everlasting childhood memory. We also are thankful for the school community joining us to watch Coco and learn about how our friends celebrate the Day of the Dead. Additionally, we are grateful for the opportunity to learn about the Native American Jingle Dress Dance (and see an eagle feather up close!) from an Abingdon parent who generously took the time to share her cultural heritage and traditions in the Abingdon Community Garden.

In other news, the Abingdon PTA is thankful for the grant requests that we received from Abingdon staff on how we can use our resources and leverage the community to meet the needs of our student population. The PTA board has agreed to fund 25 ukuleles, 30 sets of Unifix cubes, and 9 sets of dry erase multiplication manipulatives. We are also fortunate to have community donors who will help assist the Abingdon PTA with funding 4th grade's Jamestown field trip, as well as funding kindergarten and 1st grade‚Äôs field trips to the Kennedy Center. We invite other grade levels who have not reached out to us yet on connecting with us on ways we can support an educational field trip for our flock.

As we contemplate our legacy that we will leave behind for our current and incoming students, we thank our community for engaging with our team on ways to support our children. I am thankful for APS FACE Coordinator for listening to my concerns about how we can best support Abingdon ‚Äî and all APS schools ‚Äî with providing translation assistance that is needed to support our families. I am also appreciative of the Arlington County Police Department for addressing my concerns raised about pedestrian safety around our school zone. As we deal with evolving challenges to best support our flock, Abingdon's students always remain our number one priority. 

I hope you will consider staying engaged and connected with us as we continue advocating for our Cardinals: [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/AbingdonElementaryPTA), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/AbingdonPTA), [www.abingdonpta.org](https://www.abingdonpta.org), and [WhatsApp groups](/whatsapp/). Please reach out at abingdonelementarypta@gmail.com if you have any questions or comments to share with us. Thank you kindly.

Gratefully,  
Sharon Burd

The PTA is launching our first Cardinal Coding Club this month! Students in 3rd - 5th grade are invited to join us after school on Wednesdays starting in November. We are collaborating with Boolean Girl, a local non-profit, whose mission is to engage students in computer science. Registration will open on Thursday, November 10, 2022 at 12 pm; the registration link will be shared on the PTA‚Äôs Facebook and Twitter at noon. If you have any questions, reach out to Teresa Valdez-Bain at ftvedu@yahoo.com.

*Cardinal Coding Club: Mixing hands-on coding with interactive play, your young Computer Scientist will learn basic coding principles that allow them to bring stories to life. Using Scratch, a drag-and-drop multimedia programming language designed by MIT, children learn algorithms and programming all while developing and illustrating their own personal stories. Ms. Molly Fisher, Abingdon‚Äôs Instructional Technology Coordinator (ITC), will model how to plan, develop, and create a story using Scratch. Even Pixar will be impressed with the final creations!*
