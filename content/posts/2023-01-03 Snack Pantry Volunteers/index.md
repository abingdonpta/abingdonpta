The Abingdon PTA is continuing to support the school's [snack pantry](/pantry), which ensures that students facing food insecurity have access to fresh and shelf-stable food.

We need help with:

- Unpacking and organizing Amazon snacks
- Packing snack baskets for individual classrooms
- Delivering snack baskets each week

Volunteers are needed every Thursday, from 2:30 to 4:30 PM. To volunteer, click here: https://www.signupgenius.com/go/20f0c4aacab2aaaff2-abingdon1
