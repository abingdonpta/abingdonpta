## President's Message

Dear Abingdon Friends and Families,

We are thankful for the collaboration of so many hardworking educators and volunteers who work to carry out our PTA mission as set forth in our bylaws: ‚ÄúTo make every child‚Äôs potential a reality by engaging and empowering families and communities to advocate for all children.‚Äù

For example, the school library magically turned into a bookstore this week with many carts of books featuring popular titles that students love. The PTA is delighted to partner with our school library to help raise much needed funds to replenish and update our school library collection. It was particularly heartwarming that the PTA ‚Äî with much support from our community, neighbors, and a local business ‚Äî came together to provide funding for our book fair voucher fund to help ensure that every student in need could participate in the book fair. These small acts of kindness bring collective joy to our children. A heartfelt thank you to our book fair coordinators Maureen, Emily, and Tina; our librarians Ms. Fatouros and Ms. Palacios; and our many dedicated PTA book fair volunteers ‚Äî for creating such a spectacular and engaging experience for us all.

We are delighted to kick off the Read-A-Thon fundraiser next week. As you may know, the purpose of this fundraiser is twofold: 1) encourage our students' reading and 2) bring in the financial support necessary to support our students‚Äô future. The Read-a-Thon is our largest fundraiser of the year and is critical in supporting our programs, including our events (Winter Wonderland Ice Skating, Trunk or Treat), staff appreciation, and staff grants. Make sure to sign up your reader here: https://www.read-a-thon.com/readers/r/AwAipj.

Stay engaged and connected with us as we continue advocating for our Cardinals: [**Facebook**](https://www.facebook.com/AbingdonElementaryPTA), [**Twitter**](https://twitter.com/AbingdonPTA), [**www.abingdonpta.org**](https://www.abingdonpta.org), and [**WhatsApp groups**](https://www.abingdonpta.org/whatsapp/).

Gratefully,  
Sharon Burd

### üìö Abingdon Read-A-Thon Starts Next Week

Get ready to read! We celebrate the love of reading with our annual Read-A-Thon. The whole school will log reading minutes from March 13th through March 24th. Each participating student will get a prize, and we will recognize the reader with the most minutes in each grade. There's also an exciting frozen treats party for two classes with the most minutes, so make sure your student gets to help reach that goal!

This event is also the largest PTA fundraiser during the year, making many of our programs and events possible. Please set up your child's page today ‚Äî https://www.read-a-thon.com/readers/r/AwAipj ‚Äî so that they can record their minutes and collect donations from friends, family members, and neighbors. 

While the Book Swap is cancelled, the teachers and literacy team will be making sure that your students have plenty of books to choose from throughout the Read-A-Thon. The Abingdon PTA will also be replenishing the Free Little Library in the school library too!
