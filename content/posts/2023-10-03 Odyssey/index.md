Odyssey of the Mind is an international educational program that provides creative problem-solving opportunities for students from kindergarten through college. Team members apply their creativity and work together to solve a problem with their team of 5-7 students by meeting weekly to work together. Teams bring their solutions to compete at the regional meet at Wakefield High School on Saturday, March 9, 2024. Teams will meet from October through the date of the regional meet in March to work on the solution for the problem they selected. Teams may meet after school at Abingdon or at the coachâ€™s house, or a community center on the weekend if the team prefers. If your child is selected to participate on a team, you will be required to pay $45 to help with the cost of school and the meet registration fees.
