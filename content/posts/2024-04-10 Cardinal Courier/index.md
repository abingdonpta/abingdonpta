## The Details
 
### Abingdon Staffing Budget: Speak at School Board THURSDAY or email the board

As James Harlow shared in his recent update to PTA members, our advocacy to ensure proper staffing and funding for Abingdon continues. We have sent the School Board nearly 500 petition responses from the Abingdon community and have been in touch with multiple members of the School Board and senior APS staff about the critical need to continue funding a second Assistant Principal position. There are three important ways to continue weighing in: 

- Click [HERE](https://www.apsva.us/arlington-school-board/school-board-meetings/sign-up-to-speak/speaker-sign-up-form/) to sign up to speak at the Board meeting, Thursday April 11. 
- Send a message to the School Board using the [contact form HERE](https://www.apsva.us/arlington-school-board/).
- There is an important election for the School Board coming up -- the Arlington Democrats' Endorsement Caucus. Online voting starts 4/20 and goes through 5/11, with 3 in-person voting opportunities. More details here, including information about each of the candidates: https://www.arlingtondemocrats.org/sbev2024

### Help Needed: Cultural Heritage Night, April 19

[Please sign up to volunteer](https://www.signupgenius.com/go/60B094AA5A72EA75-48916874-cultural#/) for Cultural Heritage Night, 6-8 pm on Friday, April 19! This favorite annual celebration is made possible only with help from our incredible community.
