The PTA is alerting its membership that the [Superintendent's Proposed FY 2025 Budget](https://www.apsva.us/budget/) (released on February 29, 2024) proposes two staff cuts that, if implemented, would negatively impact Abingdon.

## Proposed Elimination of Abingdon's Second Assistant Principal

For years, the Abingdon community has thrived under the leadership team of Mr. Horak, Ms. Oliveira, and Mr. Micael. But the Superintendent's Proposed FY 2025 Budget defunds Abingdon's second assistant principal. In other words, **if the Superintendent's proposal is adopted, Abingdon will lose Ms. Oliveira or Mr. Micael.**

The **Abingdon PTA Executive Board is gravely concerned** about the proposed loss of Ms. Oliveira or Mr. Micael. They, along with Mr. Horak, fill many roles everyday: student advocate, crisis interventionist, community liaison, staff supervisor, and even substitute teacher. Those responsibilities are all-consuming when the three are working at full (and often excess) capacity. Take away one though, and Abingdon will suffer dramatically.

If Abingdon loses the necessary administrator support, teachers will have to try and fill the gaps. And if teachers' time and attention is diverted:

- Students would suffer educationally and emotionally.
- Staff would suffer increased stress and risk of workplace burnout.

Abingdon is particularly susceptible to these problems because **our school is exceptional in size—and the size of its needs**. Abingdon is the largest elementary school in Arlington, with 740 students. About 292 students, or 40%, are English learners; more than 100 students have a disability. And Abingdon's Title I status—over 40% of students qualify for free and reduced lunch—reflects our community's higher levels of economic need.

By defunding Abingdon's second assistant principal, the Superintendent suggests our school has the same administrator needs as Nottingham Elementary (374 students). It does not: **The number of Abingdon students qualifying for free and reduced lunch nearly equals Nottingham's total population.** 

And in the very same budget, the Superintendent proposes to maintain extra assistant principals at three middle schools (each school's third assistant principal). **Our school should not suffer, so others can benefit.**

## Proposed Elimination of 2 Classroom Teachers

The Superintendent also proposes to cut two classroom teachers at Abingdon. Abingdon is already the most underserved Title I school in Arlington district in terms of student:staff ratios. Removing two classroom teachers is not the way to fix that problem.
