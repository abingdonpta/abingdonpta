Reflections is a national PTA-sponsored program that encourages students to express themselves artistically. Each year the National PTA selects a theme and students create and submit a work of art that reflects the theme.

This year's theme is **Show Your Voice**.

## About the Competition

All Abingdon students are invited to create theme-based artwork in the categories of **literature** (written works) and **visual arts** (paintings, sculptures, drawings, and prints). All artworks will be recognized, celebrated, and judged by Abingdon volunteers by grade-level divisions. A selection of entries will advance to the county-wide competition.

## Participation instructions

Create a work of visual art or literature that reflects this year's theme of Show Your Voice. Ensure it meets the guidelines published by the National PTA (**Visual Arts guidelines**: [English](guides/English/visual-arts-category-guidelines_reflections.pdf), [Spanish](guides/Spanish/visual-arts-cat-guidelines_reflections-es.pdf)), and **Literature guidelines**: [English](guides/English/literature-category-guidelines_reflections.pdf), [Spanish](guides/Spanish/literature-cat-guidelines_reflections-es.pdf)).

1. Clearly label the back or underside of your work with your name, your teacher's name, and the title of your work.
1. Carefully drop off your work in the Reflections bin inside the school. ***We will update this page with the bin's location once we have identified the best place for it.***
1. Fill out our Entry Form ([English](forms/fillable-form_local-leader.pdf), [Spanish](forms/fillable-form_local-leader---es.pdf)) and send it to abingdonreflections@gmail.com.
