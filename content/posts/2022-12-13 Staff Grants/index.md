The Abingdon PTA started a [Grant Program](/grants) this year in order to support student learning in the classroom and beyond by funding materials, projects, and experiences beyond the core basics provided by Arlington Public Schools.

As of today, our first tranche of staff grants have been disbursed to staff. If you would like to apply for our winter grants, please do so by [following the instructions here](/grants) by January 17.

## Ukuleles

Abingdon's new music teacher, Dr. Will Heim, requested funds for 25 sets of ukuleles and a ukulele stand. Both were made by [Eric Lettau](https://twitter.com/ECigarBoxGuitar), a parent of Abingdon alums, who makes ukuleles by hand out of cigar boxes and other materials. He also made the ukulele stand out of PVC pipes.

The ukuleles will help students learn about harmonies and other elements of music. They have four strings instead of a typical six-stringed guitar, so they are simpler and easier to play.

## Multiplication Manipulatives

Ms. Kooiman, one of Abingdon's new fourth grade teachers, requested funds for dry erase multiplication manipulatives. These will help students in grades 3-5 gain a conceptual understanding of multiplication, decimals, and fractions.

## Unifix Cubes

Ms. Tice, one of Abingdon's Math Instructional Coaches, requested funds for Unifix Cubes. These math manipulatives will help students in grades K-4 to explore place value, addition, subtraction, multiplication and division. They will also be used to represent grouping and ungrouping with the foundational learning of multi-digit operations.
