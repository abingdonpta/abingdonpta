The Abingdon PTA is excited to announce that we have launched a new **online student directory** for our school. This new resource contains contact information for students’ families to help those in the Abingdon community connect to arrange playdates or carpools, discuss classroom activities, share other school-related information, and more.

Contact information has been published in the directory only for those families who completed this year’s Annual Online Verification Process (AOVP) and opted in to share their information with the PTA as part of this process. 

**If you completed the AOVP and opted in to share your data with the PTA**, please take a minute to complete the following steps to access the directory:

1. Visit the new directory website at https://abingdonpta.membershiptoolkit.com/.
2. Click “[Register/Login](https://abingdonpta.membershiptoolkit.com/login-form?r=%2Fmy_account)”.  
3. Click “[Create Account](https://abingdonpta.membershiptoolkit.com/create_account)” under “New User?”
4. Fill in the form with your information, create a password, and click “Verify my email”. (**IMPORTANT: You will need to use the same email address that you provided in ParentVUE to link to your contact record and gain access to the school directory.**)
5. After verifying your email, you will be brought to your family’s information page. For your first login only, you’ll be asked to verify your family’s contact record in the directory.

Once you create your account, you may also wish to download the Membership Toolkit app on the [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/membership-toolkit/id912169276) or [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.membershiptoolkit.mobileapp&hl=en_US&gl=US) for quick access to the directory on your mobile device.

If you did not complete the AOVP and/or did not opt in to share your data with the PTA but would like to be added to and access the directory, please contact abingdondirectory@gmail.com for assistance.

We hope you find this new tool helpful! Please send any questions or comments about the online directory to abingdondirectory@gmail.com.
