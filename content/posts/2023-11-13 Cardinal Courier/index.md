### Thanksgiving Food Drive - Help Needed

The PTA is collecting side dishes to provide Thanksgiving dinner for 30+ Abingdon families (turkeys have been donated by another organization). [We still need a few people to donate pies and dinner rolls, and 2 volunteers to help distribute food](https://www.signupgenius.com/go/20F084EA5A622A6FF2-45999547-thanksgiving):

Perishable donations (pies, dinner rolls) should be dropped off in the Abingdon office on Monday-Tuesday, Nov. 20-21 only. Non-perishable items may be dropped off at the Abingdon front office before Nov. 21. We will also collect items at the PTA meeting on Thursday, Nov. 16. 

### Reflections Art Contest: Submissions Due Friday 11/17

Our PTA is participating in Reflections - a national PTA-sponsored program that encourages students to express themselves artistically. We’re calling all Abingdon students to create visual art or literature reflecting this year’s theme: "I am Hopeful Because..." Students can create theme-based artwork in the categories of literature (written works) and visual arts (paintings, sculptures, drawings, and prints). All artworks will be recognized, celebrated, and judged by Abingdon volunteers by grade-level divisions. A selection of entries will advance to the county-wide competition. We are excited to see your talent! [More information is here](/reflections), and [in Spanish here](/es/reflections).

### Thank you to All our Supporters!
We owe the community a huge thank you for your generosity and enthusiasm so far this year! Hundreds of you turned out for Trunk or Treat last month and ensured a special day for our students. You opened your hearts and wallets to support PTA at Silver Diner, the Election Day Bake Sale, and for the upcoming Thanksgiving holiday. Your dollars are already being put to good use in classrooms and beyond. THANK YOU! 

We also want to thank our important community business supporters: Dominos Pizza, Silver Diner, Harris Teeter, Kona Ice and Einstein Bagels for their invaluable contributions to our school community so far this year. If you represent a local business and would like to discuss supporting Abingdon, please reach out to us at [pta@abingdonpta.org](mailto:pta@abingdonpta.org). 

### Update on Classroom Grants

The PTA Grants Committee has approved three classroom grant requests submitted by teachers and will consider additional applications as they come in. So far, the grant fund has covered vocabulary learning aids for the whole second Grade; flexible seating in a third Grade classroom; and the Cardinal Kids Mentoring Program.

### Teacher Appreciation

Thank you to everyone who donated to support our Teacher Appreciation Lunch last month. We were able to provide lunch to every single staffer in the building during parent-teacher conference week. We also provided bagels for staff (thanks to Einstein Bagels) on the next school day after the lockdown to kick off the day on a positive note. 

### Updated School Directory for 2023-2024 Now Available!

The Abingdon PTA is excited to announce that the online student directory has been updated with teacher information and new student records for the 2023-2024 school year. The directory helps the Abingdon community connect to arrange playdates or carpools, discuss classroom activities, share other school-related information, and more.

Contact information has been published in the directory only for those families who completed this year’s [Online Back to School Packet](https://www.apsva.us/registration/online-back-to-school-packet/) and opted in to share their information with the PTA as part of this packet.
