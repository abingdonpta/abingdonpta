Amazon is donating more than $250,000 worth of products from Amazon Fresh to Food For Neighbors, Abingdon Elementary School, and DC Food Project to support more students facing food insecurity have access to fresh and shelf-stable food.

Abingdon is using Amazonâ€™s donation to build snack baskets in our classrooms, filled with items like granola bars, cheese crackers, etc. from Amazon. These snack baskets will help make food more accessible.

We need help with:

- Unpacking and organizing Amazon snacks
- Packing snack baskets for individual classrooms
- Delivering snack baskets each week

Volunteers are needed every Thursday, from 2:30 to 4:30 PM. To volunteer, click here: https://www.signupgenius.com/go/20f0c4aacab2aaaff2-abingdon
