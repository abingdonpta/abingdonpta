## The Details
The first day of school is just around the corner, and the Abingdon PTA has some exciting updates to share. 

## Reminder: Brief General Membership Meeting Tomorrow
General Membership Meeting Tuesday, Aug 22, 5:30pm. This meeting will be very brief and the sole agenda item is a proposed dues increase from $5 to $10 per individual, in order to cover the increase in dues to our state and national PTAs. Current PTA members are invited to attend and vote.
> For security reasons, we do not share Zoom meeting codes on our website. [Please subscribe to the email edition of our newsletter](https://us11.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=e8c2877018f64aa7e1fd2e884&id=b884e2a18e) to make sure you receive PTA meeting codes. 

## Icy FUNdraisers @ Abingdon Open House
Abingdon’s Open House is this Thursday from 1:30 to 3 PM. After meeting your teacher, cool off behind the cafeteria with a Kona Ice. 20% of all sales will go to the Abingdon PTA! And speaking of your teacher, why not sweeten them up with a Kona Ice? [DONATE NOW so your teacher also can enjoy a Kona Ice!](https://abingdonpta.memberhub.com/store/items/887833) Donations also can be made during the Open House at the PTA table in the cafeteria.

## Volunteers, Your PTA Needs You
[Register NOW to volunteer with PTA during 2023-2024!](https://docs.google.com/forms/u/2/d/e/1FAIpQLSf50HFDkNfDxP5VfE2LzsxKbUPZdmRGQTeNEUhXkU_qLCLWZQ/viewform?usp=sf_link)

PTA can’t host fun events, show our amazing Abingdon staff some love, and raise funds (to have fun and show love) without parent volunteers. Opportunities are available for those who can give just a little and those who can give a little more. 

Our first opportunity to help out is this Wednesday, August 23. Volunteers are needed to distribute Edukit supplies to classrooms before the start of the year. [Sign up here](https://www.signupgenius.com/go/20F084EA5A622A6FF2-abingdon1)!

## Domino’s Pizza Fundraiser: Tuesday, September 12
