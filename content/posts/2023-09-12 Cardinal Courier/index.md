Opportunities are available for those who can give just a little and those who can give a little more. 

### Link your Harris Teeter VIC Card to Support the PTA

Link your VIC card to our school today with code 5748. [Link online](https://tie.harristeeter.com/tie/login), through the HT app or at checkout.

### Abingdon Student Directory

In December 2022, the Abingdon PTA launched a new [online student directory](https://abingdonpta.membershiptoolkit.com/) for our school. The directory contains contact information for students’ families to help those in the Abingdon community connect to arrange playdates, discuss classroom activities, share other school-related information, and more.

*For returning Abingdon families*, the directory remains available; please[ log in](https://abingdonpta.membershiptoolkit.com/) to verify/update your contact information. You may also wish to update teacher assignments for your child(ren) or add a new student record if applicable. If you never set up your account last year, you can do so now by [following these instructions](https://www.abingdonpta.org/2022/12/01/directory/).

*For new Abingdon families*, the Abingdon PTA will update the directory this year based on the information families submit in the[ Online Back-to-School Packet](https://www.apsva.us/registration/online-back-to-school-packet/). The directory will contain information and be accessible for only those families who opt in to share such information with the PTA as part of this annual online verification process. The deadline to complete the online packet is October 31, 2023, and the PTA will update the directory as soon as possible after that date.

### Eagle Scouts Support Abingdon

Eagle Scout Troop 106 has supported a range of projects at Abingdon over the past year! Last school year, projects included building a garden shed and painting a USA mural on the back playground. This year, Eagle Scout Faris Kiamie created signs in multiple languages to position throughout the school. The signs produced in Amharic, Arabic, English, Mongolian, and Spanish, help to guide students and families to major rooms, mark major rooms, provide important school-related information, and direct families, through QR codes in the front window, to the Abingdon website in these languages. Faris, who has a love of learning languages, designed the project with the support of the school leadership and PTA, hoping that these signs will help families to be more comfortable in and familiar with the school while ensuring students feel seen and included in the school community. Way to go, Faris!

More Eagle Scout projects are in the works for the future. It means so much to have this continuous relationship with the broader Fairlington community.

### PTA Membership Signups

It’s time to [renew your membership](https://www.abingdonpta.org/join/) for the 2023-2024 school year. The Abingdon PTA has two overarching goals. First, we support our students and staff by ensuring they have what they need to succeed during the school day. Second, we build community by hosting events like Trunk-or-Treat and Multicultural Night. The PTA Board strives for members to have a positive and fun experience, while always remaining free to choose their own level of involvement.

Our next General Membership Meeting will be announced soon. Thanks!
