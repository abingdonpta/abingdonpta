Reflections is a national PTA-sponsored program that encourages students to express themselves artistically. Each year the National PTA selects a theme and students create and submit a work of art that reflects the theme.

This year's theme is "**I am Hopeful Because...**"

## About the Competition

All Abingdon students are invited to create theme-based artwork in the categories of **literature** (written works) and **visual arts** (paintings, sculptures, drawings, and prints). All artworks will be recognized, celebrated, and judged by Abingdon volunteers by grade-level divisions. A selection of entries will advance to the county-wide competition.
