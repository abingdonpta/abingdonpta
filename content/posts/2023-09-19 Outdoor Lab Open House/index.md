The Outdoor Lab welcomes all Arlington families to our fall Open House on October 1, 10 AM - 4 PM. 

Join us to explore the mountain trails, meadows, streams, and pond. 

While at the Lab, your family can:

- fish in the pond (cane poles & worms provided!)
- paddle the boats
- hike our trails (over 5 miles, various abilities)
- observe critters in our Nature Center (maybe pet a snake?)
- find a perfect spot for a family picnic! (bring your lunch!)

To help manage visitors, we need families to [Pre-Register Here](https://secure.lglforms.com/form_engine/s/CoUZWlGhOXEJhH0kqRGgKg). Each registration is for **one carload** so please do not register for a ticket for each person in your car.

Tickets are "donate what you can" in support the Arlington Outdoor Education Association, a 501c3, tax exempt organization, that owns and maintains the Lab property and facilities.

Please remember that:

- all visitors must sign in
- NO dogs allowed
- please leave only footsteps and take only pictures

We look forward to seeing you!
