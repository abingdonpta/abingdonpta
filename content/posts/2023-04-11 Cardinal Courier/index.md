## üôè Thank You

- A heartfelt thank you for the extremely generous grant from the Arlington Community Foundation for field trip funding support.  This grant funding will be used to cover the transportation costs for field trips requested by each grade level teaching team.  Thank you ACF for making a positive impact on our school community and helping our Cardinals to soar.  These educational field trip experiences (e.g., visiting the Kennedy Center or the Smithsonian Zoo) help reinforce students' classroom learning. Most importantly, it provides everlasting memories to our entire student population as they enjoy the learning experience with their friends and classmates. 
- A huge thank you to our Abingdon first grade Cardinal Jack Landis for adding a beautiful outdoor Little Free Library to Abingdon's campus.  Jack is extremely thankful to the Shirlington Animal Hospital for sponsoring his project.  Together with his mom Tammie Dzubak, they assembled and painted it, and plan to keep it stocked with books by diverse authors as well as books about different abilities until it hopefully becomes self-sustaining.  We are thankful to first grader Jack for sharing the love of reading with our Cardinal flock.  Stop by the Abingdon bus loop to pick out (or leave) a book in our new Little Free Library!
