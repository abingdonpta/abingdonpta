## President's Message

Dear Abingdon Friends and Families,

We truly appreciate everybody who has given their time, energies, and talent to support the Abingdon PTA and our school community. As I reflect back on the past year, I am reminded of the garden challenges we have encountered (e.g. a wheelbarrow‚Äôs flat tire, vandalism and theft, and plant diseases) and the strong network of people who care and give their time to help. Many of our Cardinals are especially thankful for the sweet strawberries and the three types of garden-fresh tomatoes that our friends from Thomas Jefferson Middle School gifted our garden. 

To that end, the Abingdon PTA is thrilled to announce that local high school student Thomas Totten will be building a custom garden shed as a part of his Eagle Scout Project Plan for the Abingdon Community Garden. We greatly admire Thomas‚Äô thoughtful input and leadership to execute this much-needed project.

You may be interested to know that former PTA president Libby Garvey shared with me that during her time at Abingdon in the 1990s, many families had gathered over a cast iron pot with food from the Abingdon garden to make soup. As we celebrate both the successes and challenges of the garden, the stone soup story is a reminder that the Abingdon PTA is a reflection of our community‚Äôs strength. 

What we do collectively (e.g., [Holiday Gift Card Drive in support of 40 Abingdon families](https://www.abingdonpta.org/2022/11/09/holiday-gift-card-drive/), [staff grant program](https://www.abingdonpta.org/grants/), [teachers‚Äô wishlist](https://www.abingdonpta.org/wishlists/), connecting families via our new [student directory](https://www.abingdonpta.org/2022/12/01/directory/)) enhances our family-school partnership. It is particularly heartwarming to see students‚Äô joy at dismissal after they have returned from a memorable and educational school field trip. I enjoy how our organization, like the school garden, nurtures friendships and celebrates our rich diversity. 

We hope you will consider staying engaged and connected with us as we continue advocating for our Cardinals: [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/AbingdonElementaryPTA), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/AbingdonPTA), [www.abingdonpta.org](https://www.abingdonpta.org/), and [WhatsApp groups](https://www.abingdonpta.org/whatsapp/). Please reach out at abingdonelementarypta@gmail.com if you have any questions or comments to share with us. Thank you for your commitment to elevating our Cardinal flock‚Äôs elementary experience.

Wishing you health and happiness. 

Gratefully,  
Sharon Burd

P.S. Please visit the school garden ([handy garden map](https://www.abingdonpta.org/garden)) and see the plants that have been gifted from many friends in our community. Let me know if you would like me to give you a garden tour too.
