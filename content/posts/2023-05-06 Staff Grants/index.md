The Abingdon PTA started a [Grant Program](/grants) this year in order to support student learning in the classroom and beyond by funding materials, projects, and experiences beyond the core basics provided by Arlington Public Schools.

Our third tranche of staff grants have been disbursed to staff. If you would like to apply for our grants in the future, please do so by [following the instructions here](/grants) next school year.

## STEM Bins

The PTA was excited to deliver these STEM bin materials to Mrs. Edmonds, who accepted them on behalf of the second grade team. Abingdon's 2nd grade students will use these STEM activity bins to help foster creativity & problem-solving.

## Eco-Action Vests

At an Eco-Action Committee meeting, we delivered high-visibility vests that were paid for by a PTA grant. Students will wear their vest when doing work (gardening, recycling, &/or picking up litter) on campus. Thank you Cardinals for your environmental stewardship at Abingdon!

## Math Dice T-Shirts

The PTA bought t-shirts for Abingdon's Math Dice team, who competed against other Arlington elementary schools in a tournament on May 6. The shirts feature the team's award-winning name as well as each of the team members' names.
