## Abingdon Student Directory Coming This Fall

The Abingdon PTA is pleased to announce we intend to create an **online student directory** during the 2022-2023 school year. This new directory will help families in the Abingdon community connect to arrange playdates or carpools,  discuss classroom activities, and share other school-related information. It will contain information for only those families who have **opted in** to share such information with the PTA as part of the Annual Online Verification Process that all families complete annually. **Only those families who “opt in” will have access to the directory**.

To learn more about the directory and how to opt in, view the announcement on our website: https://www.abingdonpta.org/2022/09/06/directory/

## New This Year — Reflections Art Contest

<img src="images/r---show-your-voice_facebook-cropped.webp" alt="Reflections Call for Entries flyer" width="360" height="505" class="flyer" >

The Abingdon PTA is excited to announce that we will be participating in the Reflections Art Contest this year. Reflections is a national PTA-sponsored program that encourages students to express themselves artistically. Each year the National PTA selects a theme and students create and submit a work of art that reflects the theme.

This year's theme is **Show Your Voice**. All Abingdon students are invited to create theme-based artwork in the categories of **literature** (written works) and **visual arts** (paintings, sculptures, drawings, and prints). All artworks will be recognized, celebrated, and judged by Abingdon volunteers by grade-level divisions. A selection of entries will advance to the county-wide competition.

To learn more about how to participate, view the announcement on our website: https://www.abingdonpta.org/reflections/
