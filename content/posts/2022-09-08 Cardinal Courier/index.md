## President's Message

Dear Abingdon Friends and Families,

I hope your cardinals are having a strong start to the school year. I've enjoyed seeing returning families and meeting new students and educators who recently joined our school. It was heartwarming to see our fellow cardinals make new friends at our Back-to-School Picnic and at the rising Kindergarten Summer Popsicle Playdates. Your PTA team is excited to continue building and strengthening our Abingdon community through our events, activities, and programs.

Everybody is welcome to participate in the PTA; however, consider becoming a dues paying member (a requirement in our organization for voting; [pay your dues here](https://abingdonpta.memberhub.com/store/items/717576)). I would also encourage you to lend an hour of your time to volunteer with us too. There are several ways to connect with the Abingdon PTA. In addition to regularly updating [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/AbingdonElementaryPTA), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/AbingdonPTA), and [www.abingdonpta.org](https://www.abingdonpta.org), we also launched [WhatsApp groups](/whatsapp/) for families to connect with each other.

As Elizabeth Andrew shared, ‚ÄúVolunteers do not necessarily have the time; they have the heart.‚Äù Help us be a strong and powerful advocate for our flock of cardinals. I look forward to meeting you; if you happen to see me, please stop by to say ‚ÄúHello!‚Äù

Gratefully,  
Sharon Burd  
PTA President

P.S. [Don‚Äôt forget to link your Harris Teeter VIC card to Abingdon Elementary.](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeiAe72qt4qTb_b2xmB-TUZByVkD-QxfVNyFEEHGc6sGkFzYQ/viewform) We currently have 54 participants for this school year.
