Arlington Public Schools recently published a "Facility Condition Assessment Report," which assessed the condition of every school facility, including Abingdon. The report is intended to prioritize certain schools for significant renovations. As Abingdon was last renovated in 2016-2017, it is not a high priority to receive significant renovations. Still, the report provides a summary description of the school facility and lists areas of improvement. These include substandard ventilation in some classrooms, the lack of a proper outdoor classroom, and the lack of water-efficient fixtures.

A description of the report [is available here](https://www.apsva.us/departments/facilities-operations/long-range-plan-to-renovate-existing-school-facilities/facility-condition-assessment-report-at-a-glance/). The overall report [is available here](https://www.apsva.us/wp-content/uploads/sites/57/2023/10/20231026-APS-Long-Range-Renovation-Study-Project-Report-w-atchs.pdf). The pages addressing Abingdon (pages 39-42) are available below.
