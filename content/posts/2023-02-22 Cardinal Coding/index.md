We're excited to offer a spring session for the Cardinal Coding Club. Ms. Molly Fisher, Abingdonâ€™s Instructional Technology Coordinator (ITC), will model how to plan, develop, and create a story using Scratch. The PTA is excited to continue its partnership with Boolean Girl, a local non-profit, whose mission is to engage students in computer science.
