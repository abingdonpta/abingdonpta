The Abingdon PTA has launched a fabulous new website that's **Informative**, **fast**, and **cheap**.

- **Informative**: The site's content is completely up-to-date, with information about PTA roles, important documents, and highlights of PTA programs.
- **Fast**: The site is very fast. Pages load almost instantly and use minimal resources. The new site won't spin up your laptop fan or burn though your mobile data cap.
- **Cheap**: The site costs nothing to host. This is a considerable savings from our previous website host. We also changed domain registrars; together, the two changes result in savings of $500 per year.

Highlights of the new website include:
- [The leadership page](/leadership/) lists all of our officers and coordinators - and clicking on each positions provides a detailed description of each role.
- [The history page](/history/) is a great way to learn more about our school's 72 year history.
- [The documents page](/documents/) offers easy access to our bylaws, meeting minutes and other helpful information.

If you have suggestions for the new website, share them with us at abingdonelementarypta@gmail.com.

For those interested in technical details, the new website runs on [Hugo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hugo_(software)), a static site generator. It's uploaded to Github and hosted on Cloudflare.

If you'd like to serve as a backup administrator for this website, please reach out to abingdonelementarypta@gmail.com. We'd be happy to show you the ropes.
