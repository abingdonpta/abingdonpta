Girls on the Run is coming to Abingdon Elementary School! GOTR is a physical activity based positive youth development program for girls in 3rd-8th grade. The program teaches life skills through dynamic interactive lessons and running games. The goal of the program is to unleash confidence through accomplishment, while establishing a lifetime appreciation of health and fitness. Our program has been adapted to ensure physical distancing and safety. In-person practices include safety, sanitizing, and physical distancing precautions and modifications.

Starting the week of March 6th and ending May 20-21, the team will meet every Monday & Wednesday from 2:50 PM - 3:50 PM. The program culminates in a celebratory 5K at the end of the season! The standard program fee is $185 and includes 20 lessons/practices, a t-shirt, water bottle, entry into the 5K, a 5K medal, and more. Financial assistance is available for anyone who needs it, with the lowest program registration cost being $22 for the season. Registration begins on February 6th at www.gotrnova.org. 

Registration for the Spring 2023 program is open from February 6 through 28, and the season will run from the week of March 6 through May 21. The standard program fee is $185, but we also offer military and sibling discounts, as well as financial assistance available for all families.
