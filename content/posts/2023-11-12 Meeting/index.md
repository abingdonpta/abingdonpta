Join us this Thursday, November 16, for the next general membership meeting of the Abingdon PTA. We'll meet from 5:15 - 6:15 in the Abingdon school library.

At this meeting, we'll

- preview PTA's upcoming fall and winter events, including a Craft Night, a Bingo/Raffle Night, and Winter Wonderland;
- hear from APS Safety and Security about the recent lockdown at Abingdon and lessons learned from the event.

Childcare and pizza will be provided again in the cafeteria.
