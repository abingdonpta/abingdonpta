The Abingdon Elementary PTA is seeking members to join a Nominating Committee to identify next year's PTA officers.

The role of the Nominating Committee, [as described in our bylaws](/bylaws/#article-5-officers-and-their-election), is to nominate PTA members to serve as officers the following year. Officer roles are the President, Treasurer, Secretary, as well as Vice President roles.

As a member of the Nominating Committee, you would identify PTA members interested in serving as officers, and report to the general membership a list of nominees for the annual election.

At least three people need to serve on the committee, all of whom need to be dues-paying PTA members. The committee needs to be approved by the PTAâ€™s membership at the March 14 meeting. The nominating committee will then submit the officer nominees to the general membership in April so that the election can be held in May.

If you're interested in serving on the Nominating Committee, [please fill out this form by March 7](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSf9PdHN9R_Wcu1n7hXxdEDl2KCrcZEY4uc6BzfDw_V_j3HMzQ/viewform?usp=sf_link). If you have questions about what's involved in the role, please email abingdonptasecretary@gmail.com.

This is a great way to have a say in the future of the PTA. Thank you!
