## The Details

### Holiday Drive for Abingdon Families - Slots Still Available!

The Abingdon Elementary School social workers and PTA are working together to support families in need in our community this holiday season. [You can help by "adopting" a family here - or joining forces with neighbors and friends to do so](https://www.signupgenius.com/go/20F084EA5A622A6FF2-46423977-abingdon#/). We are asking donors to provide toys or books for the children or Target gift cards **(on sale THIS weekend only**) for the families to buy their own gifts, and grocery gift cards. Families with young children (kindergarten and younger) would also appreciate sweatshirts and sweatpants. Families will also receive new coats, winter gear, and games from the school, so other gifts are preferred through this collection effort.

Donations will be collected at the school office, 3035 S Abingdon St, Arlington, VA 22206, between Dec. 11 and Dec. 15. Please combine all items for a single family in one shopping bag or gift bag, and label it with the family's number. If you cannot drop off the items during school hours, contact Sara Kirschner, ridge.sara@gmail.com, to make other arrangements. Thank you for your generosity and support of our Abingdon community. Happy Holidays!
