We will accept nominations from the floor for the 2024-2025 PTA Board, which will be elected at our June meeting. [Read more about the positions here](/2024/04/22/elections/). We also will vote on a budgetary amendment to ensure sufficient funds are available to support Field Day. [Updated financials are available here](/reports/2024-05-16_1.pdf). 

Childcare and pizza for the kids will be provided; [please just RSVP](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfthsG7AfcW6CkMkt7YDQ-UwSS5biI3sEYVFNL_-ECe8sA-8w/viewform) so we have a good headcount. If you can’t make the meeting in-person, join us on zoom.

## New Pollinator Garden at Abingdon!

A special thank you to Abingdon's Master Gardener Pat and dedicated garden volunteers - Sarah, Willa, Malika, Adriana, Dan, Bella, James, and Eleanor, as well as Claremont friends Vera, Rudy, and Camilla - who helped weed and plant Abingdon’s new native pollinator "traffic triangle" garden.

## ICYMI: Second Assistant Principal Funded for 2024-2025

We have good news about the funding of our second assistant principal for next school year. Last month, APS authorized funding for the position for the 2024-2025 school year through the Human Resources contingency process. PTA extends its sincere thanks to all students, staff, parents, and community members for their immediate and overwhelming support on this issue. Without your advocacy, this victory would not have been possible. 

While we celebrate the maintenance of staffing for next year, the position is again funded via contingency; it has not been converted to a permanent one. That next step depends on the results of the ongoing planning factor study by APS.

The past few months have opened our eyes to the need for revisions of the planning factors for elementary school administrators (and other staff positions). Without changes, we may have to renew this fight again next year. Rest assured that PTA will remain engaged with senior APS staff and School Board members about this issue over the coming months.
