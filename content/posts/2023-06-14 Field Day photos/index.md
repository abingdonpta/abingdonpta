Abingdon's Field Day rocks! Shout out to Mr. Reed, Mr. Spadaro, and Mr. Collazos for planning an incredible experience for our Cardinal students. Thank you to all the volunteers and staff for their support too.

The final Read-a-Thon prize (because Abingdon students surpassed their reading goals) was awarded at field day today: water balloons at Mr. Micael.
