### Book Fair: [Volunteers Needed](https://www.signupgenius.com/go/10C0948ABA629A2FA7-47323275-abingdon) next week

We're still working to fill a few remaining [volunteer spots](https://www.signupgenius.com/go/10C0948ABA629A2FA7-47323275-abingdon) for the Abingdon book fair, next week in the Library! We especially need help Tuesday evening. Join us for this fun event and help make sure all our students receive books they love. [You can also donate to the book fund](https://abingdonpta.memberhub.com/store/items/973109) for students without the means to purchase books.

### Girls on the Run Registration Now Open

We are excited that we will be offering another season of Girls on the Run this Spring. [Registration is now open for 3rd through 5th graders](https://www.pinwheel.us/register/index/PROGRAMREGSP24?sid=2e203ac623a5464cafc78d64774d9261). We can't wait for another fantastic season of running and growing together, capped off by celebrating our big achievement of running our Arlington Community GOTR 5K. We are also still looking for coaches; see the image and/or email ashleybethmccarthy@gmail.com.

### Thank you Community Sponsors!

Thanks to all who joined us for a raucous first-annual BINGO night in the cafeteria! We had a wonderful time, made possible by our generous community sponsors including Duck Donuts, the Chrissy and Lisa Team, Ramparts, UnWined, Jeni's Ice Cream and more. Thanks also to Taco Bamba for hosting a fundraising night bringing in over $400 for Abingdon PTA! It was great to see so many school families enjoying delicious food while supporting our school community. 

### Want to be interviewed for Amazing Abingdon (3/1)?

March 1st is the Amazing Abingdon event in which parents/guardians will be visiting the building, spending time in their students' classrooms. Abingdon will be filming a video during the event and is hoping to interview a few parents on their experience. Email Molly Fisher if interested: molly.fisher@apsva.us.
