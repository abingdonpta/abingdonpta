You are cordially invited to join us for a garden service opportunity to honor Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. on Monday, January 16 from 10 a.m. – 12 p.m.

The PTA is partnering with the Fairlington Citizens Association to sponsor a MLK Day of Service Garden Workday at the Abingdon Community Garden. Everybody is welcome to lend a helping hand to support our garden goals: planting seeds in mini greenhouses, weeding the area, picking up litter, as well as layering the garden grounds with additional cardboard and donated wood chips.

A guest reader will provide a storytime to kids in attendance to honor Dr. King’s leadership with the civil rights movement and the importance of building community through volunteer service.

We would love your support to maintain a successful, sustainable community garden. Prior gardening experience is not required. Bring your water bottle, as well as your garden gloves and shovel if you have one. Scope out our garden map here: [www.abingdonpta.org/garden](/garden). We hope you will join us.

- **When**: Monday, January 16, 2023 from 10:00 am – 12:00 pm
- **Where**: Abingdon Community Garden, next to the school.
