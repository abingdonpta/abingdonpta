Last month, Abingdon Elementary published its School Action Plan for 2023-2024 through 2025-2026, which describes its strategic goals and how it intends to achieve and measure them. The goals include:
- reducing gaps between different demographics in reading, math, and science assessments;
- reducing chronic absenteeism; and
- improving partnerships with families.

On that last point, the school intends to conduct a survey of parents at a future PTA meeting to measure its progress.
