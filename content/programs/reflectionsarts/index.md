In the Reflections program, students in Pre-K through Grade 12 create original works of art in response to a student-selected theme. This 50+ year-old program helps them explore their own thoughts, feelings and ideas, develop artistic literacy, increase confidence and find a love for learning that will help them become more successful in school and in life.

Abingdon students participate in the appropriate division for their grade: Primary (Pre-K - Grade 2) or Intermediate (Grades 3-5).
