## Food Drive

The PTA organizes canned food drives, particularly during school events. A bin is placed in an accessible location and its contents are donated to the Arlington Food Assistance Center (AFAC).

## Winter Clothing Drive

The PTA supports Abingdon families by collecting winter clothing for children whose families cannot afford them. More information will be available this fall.
