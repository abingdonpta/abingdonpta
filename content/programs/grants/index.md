## What is the Staff and Student Activities Grant Program?

The Abingdon PTA Staff and Student Activities Grant Program funds materials, projects, and experiences beyond the core basics provided by Arlington Public Schools. Grants support learning experiences during the school day, extracurricular activities (ex. student clubs), and other initiatives that benefit the school community. The Grant Program prioritizes requests that would benefit the largest number of students possible or address a significant need otherwise unmet by APS resources.

## How does the grant process work?

- The PTA allocates funds for grants in September as part of its annual budget. For the 2023-2024 school year, the PTA budgeted **$5,500** for the Grant Program.
- Grant requests may be submitted at any time. All requests are reviewed on a rolling basis by the Staff and Student Activities Grant Committee until the budgeted funds have been dispensed.
- Requests may be funded in whole, in part, or not at all, at the discretion of the Staff and Student Activities Grant Committee.
- When a grant is approved, the PTA will pay directly for the item or service whenever possible.
- The awardee will [sign this form](files/grant-program-agreement.pdf), agreeing that the granted items are now property of Abingdon Elementary School; that the PTA will not be responsible for any maintenance or subsequent costs; and that the items will stay at Abingdon Elementary regardless of staff turnover.

## When are grants awarded?

Grant requests are reviewed on a rolling basis throughout the year until all budgeted funds have been dispensed.

## Who can apply for grants?

Any member of the Abingdon staff may apply for themselves, on behalf of several staff members (ex. a grant request by all 3rd Grade teachers), or as the staff representative for a student club or other extracurricular activity.

## What is the PTA looking for in a grant application?

Applications should identify the purpose of the grant and explain the anticipated benefit to the Abingdon community. Applications should provide an itemized breakdown, to the extent feasible, of how funds would be used and when funds would be needed.

Grants cannot be used to pay for items already purchased, something that will only benefit a small number of students, capital expenses, IEP materials, professional memberships or training, or curriculum materials which are the responsibility of APS. Grant funds also cannot be used to purchase headphones, which principals should provide to staff upon request. (Superintendent Dur√°n stated this during the [January](files/ccpta-1.pdf#page=2) and [February](files/ccpta-2.pdf#page=2) 2023 CCPTA meetings.)
