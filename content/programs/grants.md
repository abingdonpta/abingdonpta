The Abingdon PTA intends to provide grants to support Abingdon students. We encourage Abingdon staff to apply for grants using the form below.

The PTA Executive Board will review pending grant requests at its monthly meetings, or on a staggered basis to ensure an even distribution of funds. According to our bylaws, requests over $500 that were not previously budgeted must also be approved by the PTA's general membership at their monthly meetings.

All disbursements of funds are subject to fundraising success and PTA participation. We wish that we could fund all requests, but unfortunately we are not always able to do so. **Higher priority is given to proposals that would directly benefit all Abingdon students, however, staff may also submit proposals that would directly benefit students in individual classrooms or grade levels.** We appreciate your time and look forward to reviewing your request.

Thank you for your continued support and commitment to the Abingdon PTA.
