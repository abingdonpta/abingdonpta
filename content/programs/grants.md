## What is the Grant Program?

The Abingdon PTA Grant Program supports student learning in the classroom and beyond by funding materials, projects, and experiences beyond the core basics provided by Arlington Public Schools. The Grant Program prioritizes those requests that benefit the largest number of students possible or to meet a community identified need otherwise unmet by APS resources.

## How does the grant process work?

- The PTA allocates funds for grants in September as part of its annual budget. For the 2022-2023 school year, the PTA has budgeted **$3,400** for grants.
- This money is split into three tranches to be granted in the fall, winter, and spring. The Executive Board votes on grant applications at their meetings.
- Grant requests may be funded, in whole or in part, by a business donor, with the mutual consent of the donor and the staff recipient. This is a great way for local businesses to support their neighborhood school, and to stretch PTA funds further.
- When a grant is approved, the PTA will pay directly for the item or service whenever possible.

## When are grants awarded?

| Season | Grant Deadline | Executive Board meeting | Money to be Granted |
| ------ | -------------- | ----------------------- | ------------------- |
| Fall   | October 18 | October 25 | $1,100 |
| Winter | January 17 | January 24 | $1,100 |
| Spring | March 21   | March 28   | $1,200 |

## Who can apply for grants?

Any individual member of the Abingdon staff or team of educators may apply.

## What is the PTA looking for in a grant application?

Grant requests should provide a beneficial impact to a wide range of students (e.g., an entire grade, multiple grades, or the whole school) and a long-term or sustainable benefit to the school. Grants can be used to enrich classroom learning, support cultural arts program, school visits, field trips, and items and activities that benefit a large number of students.

Grants cannot be used to pay for items already purchased, something that will only benefit a small number of students or an individual teacher, capital expenses, IEP materials, professional memberships or training, or curriculum materials which are the responsibility of APS. Grant funds also cannot be used to purchase headphones, which principals should provide to staff upon request, according to the APS superintendent.

**Grant requests should be between $100 and $500.**
