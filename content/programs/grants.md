The Abingdon PTA provides grants to the needs of the school. We encourage Abingdon staff to apply for grants using the form below.

The PTA Executive Board reviews pending grant requests at its monthly meetings. According to our bylaws, requests over $500 that were not previously budgeted must also be approved by the PTA's general membership at their monthly meetings.

All disbursements of funds are subject to fundraising success and PTA participation. We wish that we could fund all requests, but unfortunately are not always able to do so. We appreciate your time and look forward to reviewing your request.

Thank you for your continued support and commitment to Abingdon Elementary.
