# Room Buddies

The Abingdon PTA is starting a "Room Buddies" program. You may have heard about "Room Parents" or "Class Moms" at other schools, and this is intended to be similar.

Room Buddies facilitate communication between their fellow parents, teachers, and the PTA. We would like as many classrooms to have a Room Buddy as possible. The goals of the program are:

- to ensure the PTA is aware of teachers' needs so that the PTA can help to meet them
- to ensure parents are informed about PTA events and opportunities
- to ensure parents can communicate with each other

The responsibilities of a Room Buddy are:

- to communicate regularly with their child's teacher in order to assess classroom needs
- to maintain a contact list of parents in their child's classroom (the PTA can help with this)
- to attend PTA meetings and read PTA emails in order to be informed about PTA goings-on - and to inform their fellow parents

This is intended to be a minimal time commitment. Room Buddies are not expected to plan events or fulfill other PTA responsibilities, though they are certainly welcome to do so.
